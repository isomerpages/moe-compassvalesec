## Partnership with Parents&nbsp;

Partnership involves parents, families, and school working together to benefit children. Each recognises, respects and values what the other party does and says. Partnership involves responsibility from all parties. In CVSS, we value this partnership and are appreciative of the firm support from our parents. This year, with the lifting of COVID-19 regulations, our school is resuming our face-to-face interaction and partnership with our parents. With our newly formed Parent Support Group (PSG) EXCO, they will gradually be involved in school programmes that showcased positive role-modelling for our students to see that their parents are always ready to support them in achieving their fullest potential.
 

## Parent Support Group (PSG)

 ### Who are we?

We are parents of CVSS students who are keen to take an active role in shaping the crucial teenage years of our children.


### Parent Engagement Events - 2022

1. Secondary One Parent's Talk

As part of the school’s orientation programme for Secondary 1 students, the Secondary 1 Parent's Talk was organised for parents to gain an overview of secondary school life in CVSS and provide them with an understanding of how they may support their children during the transition. Due to the prevailing safe management measures (SMM), a webinar session involving the various school key personnel was conducted for parents. We shared information on various aspects of the CVSS secondary school journey, including holistic development within the compulsory curriculum, CCA requirements and our expectations of student behaviour. Mr Christopher Lian, Chairperson of our PSG, also introduced parents to the PSG and shared his personal parenting journey with the participants. In addition, parents also had the chance to meet with their children’s form teachers in a separate class Zoom room, which allowed them to interact with their children’s form teachers and get to know fellow parents of the same class.

  

2. PSG organized zoom parenting workshop&nbsp;

The PSG organised an inaugural online parenting workshop for all parents via Zoom - “I can’t live without it!” – Understanding &amp; Engaging Our Digital Natives. The turnout was encouraging. We recorded close to 60 parent-participants who signed up for the workshop. The feedback received was encouraging as they found the workshop useful. In addition, they expressed that the workshop conducted via Zoom made it more accessible and provided them flexibility to attend it.

3. Meet The Form Teacher (MTFT) session

As SMM eases with the gradual shift and changes of the pandemic situation, the school was able to resume this year’s MTFT on 27 May with parents and teachers in-person on school grounds after a two-year hiatus. The sign-up rate was high and we are heartened to note parents’ support for their children’s growth and progress here in CVSS. Form teachers also returned the enthusiasm with their presence and interaction during the MTFT session.

### Parent Engagement Events - 2021

**1. Secondary One Parent’s Talk**  

As part of the school’s effort in helping our Secondary One students transit to secondary school life, the Secondary One Parent’s Talk aimed to provide parents with an overview of secondary school life in CVSS to enable them to better support their children in their transition. Due to the prevailing SMM, an inaugural Webinar was conducted where the school leaders and various key personnel shared information on school matters. Mr Christopher Lian, Chairperson of our Parent Support Group (PSG), also introduced parents to PSG and shared his first-hand experiences with incoming parents. Parents also had the opportunity to interact with their children’s form teachers as well fellow parents of the same class via a class-based zoom session.

  

**2. Meet The Form Teacher sessions**  

The Covid-19 pandemic did not deter our form teachers from persisting in their efforts to “meet up” with parents to discuss the progress and development of their children. The school tapped on the affordances of technology to engage parents from all levels on 27 &amp; 28 May 2021. These sessions have enabled the form teachers to connect with the parents and strengthen their partnership in supporting the growth and development of each child.

### Parent Support Group Events

### 2021
### PSG Meeting:

Even though PSG engagements were reduced greatly during the pandemic, PSG tried to innovate and continued to conduct meetings online via platforms like Zoom . In April this year, the PSG meet-up provided an opportunity for parents to interact and share their experiences with one another on how they managed working from home and monitoring their children’s learning. School Leaders joined in the session and our Vice-Principal, Ms Jacelyn Kee took the chance to share further information about the school’s plans for Blended Learning (BL) and Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) as students from Secondary 1 to 3 would be getting their personalised learning device (PLD) by the end of the year. Feedback was gathered from the parents, which enabled the school to enhance its communication and support in this area.

Our PSG has always been passionate about co-hosting elderly guests at our annual CNY celebration and members generously volunteer to prepare festive bags for our elderly guests. Preparation for these festive bags would begin early in the year whereby PSG EXCOs would activate the donation drive in kinds only and parents of students from all levels would either contribute items or volunteer their time on a Saturday morning to pack these festive bags together with their children. On the actual day of CNY celebration, our PSG members even came to school to mingle with and take care of these elderly guests.
