**Blended Learning** is initiated by MOE in 2021 and implemented across all secondary schools. It aims to provide students a seamless blend of different modes of learning to (a) nurture self-directed and independent learners, and (b) develop passionate and intrinsically motivated learners.

### Home-Based Learning (HBL) Days

With Blended Learning, students will learn curriculum content through a mix of in-school and home-based activities, online and/or offline. As part of students’ Blended Learning experience, regular HBL Days are held about once every fortnight and students/parents will be informed of the schedule in advance. HBL days and learning packages are designed such that students will take the lead in directing and managing their learning. On HBL Days, teachers will plan a variety of learning experiences for students. The learning materials involved may include physical materials such as textbooks/worksheets or assigned ICT packages in Student Learning Space (SLS) or Google Classroom.  Lessons will be mostly asynchronous where students can complete their learning in their own time at their own pace. They will hence learn to self-organise and sequence their learning tasks for the day.  At times, students may be required to attend synchronous “live” lessons conducted by teachers via Zoom.

### Student-Initiated Learning: “North Stars SPARKLE!” Programme

On HBL days, dedicated time and space will also be catered for Student-Initiated Learning through our “North Stars SPARKLE!” Programme. The programme provides students the opportunity to explore their personal interests and learn anything outside the curriculum. Students may choose from a list of recommended learning activities by the school, or identify and pursue their own areas of interest, with guidance from teachers.
