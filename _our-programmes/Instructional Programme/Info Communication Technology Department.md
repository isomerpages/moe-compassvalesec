As part of the school’s continuous efforts to support the Smart Nation vision, the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) committee aims to promote meaningful use of ICT for active learning and developing students’ 21st century competencies. 

#### Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) Device Roll Out

As part of the National Digital Literacy Programme, every secondary student would have their own Personal Learning Device (PLD). The committee has successfully facilitated the smooth Personal Learning Device (PLD) handover in October. The PLDs will complement the existing Student Learning Space (SLS) and provision of Student ICON account with Google Applications to enhance both in-class and home-based learning. 

#### Computational Thinking Workshop  

To increase students’ exposure to computational thinking and making, ICT Committee collaborated with the Mathematics Department to conduct a two-day computational thinking workshop for Secondary 1 students. Students had a full hands-on experience in applying computational thinking and STEM concepts to solve real world problems using M5Go microcontroller with LCD screen and a variety of sensors and actuators. Students created a smart home prototype as their project.

  

Home-based Learning

The ICT Committee played a key role in supporting Blended Learning. Students were assigned online lessons on new media literacy skills and also carried out their Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) activities prepared by the SIL team. The Home-based Learning (HBL) Days provide opportunities for Sec 1 to 3 students to exercise self-directedness and learn at their own pace. 

  

#### Staff Professional Development (ICT)

As the teacher’s role shifts from one that delivers content to one that facilitates deeper learning, the committee also helps to provide teachers with the learning and networking opportunities in their professional development in ICT. The committee also works closely with the Staff Professional Development Team to level up teachers’ competency in designing with ePedagogy, use of interactive technology tools and Google Classroom.

--------------

As part of the school’s continuous efforts to support the Smart Nation vision, the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Department has led several activities in promoting meaningful use of ICT for active learning and developing students’ 21st century competencies. As the teacher’s role shifts from one that delivers content to one that facilitates deeper learning, the ICT Committee also helps to provide teachers with the learning and networking opportunities in their professional development in ICT.  

### Supporting School 

#### Full Home-based Learning

The committee played a pivot role in supporting the school in implementing Full Home Based Learning during school closure. The committee provided ICT support for design of teaching and learning activities and creation of online learning packages, conducted teacher workshop on the use of video conferencing tools, managed subject-specific emails, manned school-based helpdesk for general enquiries by students and parents, and provide admin help to resolve SLS account issues each day.  A micro school website was specially created to communicate home-based learning information and host weekly schedule for students and parents. The ICT Support team also lent their expert technical knowledge and provided resource support for our students.

### Student and Staff Engagement

As part of the school’s continuous efforts to support the Smart Nation vision, the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) committee aims to promote meaningful use of ICT for active learning and developing students’ 21st century competencies. As the teacher’s role shift from one that delivers content to one that facilitates deeper learning, the committee also helps to provide teachers with the learning and networking opportunities in their professional development in ICT.

  

#### Staff Professional Development (ICT)

To level up teachers’ competency in designing with ePedagogy, the Committee organised an engagement session to share how Student Learning Space (SLS) Pedagogy Scaffold is used to guide lesson design for active learning process and for different learning experience. Staff professional development also takes place in the form of structured ICT mentoring programme. The teacher mentor models how technology can be tapped to improve on lessons and strengthen the competency level of teacher mentee.

#### PA/AVA Robotics 2020

The members participated in the IDE Virtual Robotics Challenge 2020 and ITE Robotics Challenge 2020. They demonstrated their use of critical and creative thinking in building and programming their robot, and also displayed resilience, dedication and good sportsmanship throughout the competition.
