# Humanities Department
# 2021

The Humanities Department explored the use of Source-based Learning, Inquiry-based Learning and Assessment for Learning as important teaching tools to engage students in independent learning. Students were engaged in a range of field-based assignments and innovative performance tasks that exploited various ICT platforms such as Google Doc, Titanpad, Popplet, Toondoo, Nearpod and online games to support their learning and research projects. 

  

Through the programme Humanities Connect!, every Northstar will understand and explore how the Humanities connect him/her to the community, nation and the world. Through activities such as the Humanities and Elements of Business Skills Challenge, classroom discussions on contemporary issues, investigations on local social and geographical issues and exploration of Singapore’s history  through Learning Journeys, students will be better able to make  connections between the past and the present and appreciate the importance of living in an interdependent community with increasing global connections. 

  

The following are various authentic learning experiences that have helped them extend their learning beyond the classroom.
