# Humanities Department
# 2021

The Humanities Department explored the use of Source-based Learning, Inquiry-based Learning and Assessment for Learning as important teaching tools to engage students in independent learning. Students were engaged in a range of field-based assignments and innovative performance tasks that exploited various ICT platforms such as Google Doc, Titanpad, Popplet, Toondoo, Nearpod and online games to support their learning and research projects. 

  

Through the programme Humanities Connect!, every Northstar will understand and explore how the Humanities connect him/her to the community, nation and the world. Through activities such as the Humanities and Elements of Business Skills Challenge, classroom discussions on contemporary issues, investigations on local social and geographical issues and exploration of Singapore’s history  through Learning Journeys, students will be better able to make  connections between the past and the present and appreciate the importance of living in an interdependent community with increasing global connections. 

  

The following are various authentic learning experiences that have helped them extend their learning beyond the classroom.

All Secondary 2 students participated in an integrated Humanities and CCE Learning Journey to the National Museum of Singapore in March and April. Their learning experiences on the use of artefacts to understand the history and culture of Singapore were enhanced through the pre-LJ and post-LJ segments that were conducted as part of the CCE lesson package. The journey ended with a ceremony at the Kranji War Memorial where students had a memorable experience in commemorating the war heroes who had sacrificed their lives during World War II.

#### Secondary 1 Virtual Rainforest Tour

On 17th May 2021, the Secondary 1 Express and Normal (Academic) students participated in a Tropical Rainforest Virtual Field Trip. During the session, students were engaged through a series of 360° virtual tours and video narrations about tropical rainforests in Singapore at three locations -  Singapore Quarry, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and the Singapore Botanic Gardens. By completing various tasks in their activity booklets and a quiz, this authentic and immersive learning experience enabled students to apply the Geographical Investigation skills they have acquired during Geography lessons and draw linkages between theoretical knowledge and the real-world physical environment.

The following are various authentic learning experiences that have helped our North Stars extend their learning beyond the classroom.

  

### Humanities Department Activities (Term 1, 2020)

#### EBS Challenge

The EBS Challenge, which was held on 3rd March, is an annual event where our Secondary 3 Normal (Technical) students are given the opportunity to plan and organise meaningful and engaging activities at various game stations to enable the Secondary 2 Normal (Technical) students to understand more about EBS. The Secondary 2 students learn about some prominent Singaporean entrepreneurs through interactive games and quizzes as well as gain knowledge about local tourist attractions and financial concepts. Additionally, the students also leverage on the SLS online platform to provide answers to quiz questions as they move from one game station to the next. The experience has also allowed our students to develop critical problem solving skills as well as sharpen their communication skills.

### Humanities Department Activities (Term 2, 2020)

#### NUS Geography Challenge

This year, the whole cohort of Secondary 1 Express and Normal (Academic) students took part in the Lower Secondary Humanities Challenge via the SLS platform. Through this activity, students were engaged in authentic tasks and activities such as answering quiz questions and solving riddles related to key historical landmarks and geographical features of ASEAN countries. This made learning relevant and authentic as it provided the students an opportunity to apply their learning across different contexts. 

A team selected from our inaugural batch of Pure Geography students took part in the National University (NUS) Geography Challenge that was jointly organised by the NUS Department of Geography and the NUS Geographical Society, with support from the Ministry Of Education (MOE). Based on the theme ‘Operation Climate Change: Time for Action’, the team created a poster to highlight how individuals could play a part in combating climate change through adopting a sustainable lifestyle as well as came up with a quiz on Geography topics curated from the International Geography Olympiad syllabus. Two members of the team from Secondary 4E4 attained the Silver and Bronze medals respectively, with one of them being invited to take part in the 2021 Geography Talent Development Programme (TDP).
