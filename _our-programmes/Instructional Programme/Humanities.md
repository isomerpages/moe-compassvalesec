# Humanities Department
# 2021

The Humanities Department explored the use of Source-based Learning, Inquiry-based Learning and Assessment for Learning as important teaching tools to engage students in independent learning. Students were engaged in a range of field-based assignments and innovative performance tasks that exploited various ICT platforms such as Google Doc, Titanpad, Popplet, Toondoo, Nearpod and online games to support their learning and research projects. 

  

Through the programme Humanities Connect!, every Northstar will understand and explore how the Humanities connect him/her to the community, nation and the world. Through activities such as the Humanities and Elements of Business Skills Challenge, classroom discussions on contemporary issues, investigations on local social and geographical issues and exploration of Singapore’s history  through Learning Journeys, students will be better able to make  connections between the past and the present and appreciate the importance of living in an interdependent community with increasing global connections. 

  

The following are various authentic learning experiences that have helped them extend their learning beyond the classroom.

All Secondary 2 students participated in an integrated Humanities and CCE Learning Journey to the National Museum of Singapore in March and April.

The journey ended with a ceremony at the Kranji War Memorial where students had a memorable experience in commemorating the war heroes who had sacrificed their lives during World War II.

#### Secondary 1 Virtual Rainforest Tour

On 17th May 2021, the Secondary 1 Express and Normal (Academic) students participated in a Tropical Rainforest Virtual Field Trip. During the session, students were engaged through a series of 360° virtual tours and video narrations about tropical rainforests in Singapore at three locations -  Singapore Quarry, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and the Singapore Botanic Gardens. By completing various tasks in their activity booklets and a quiz, this authentic and immersive learning experience enabled students to apply the Geographical Investigation skills they have acquired during Geography lessons and draw linkages between theoretical knowledge and the real-world physical environment.
