The Normal Course team strongly supports the belief that “every child wants to and can learn”, thus no child should be left behind. The team aims to cultivate self-belief and self-motivation in our Normal Course students through various learning experiences. The team also hopes to cater to the varied learning needs of our students in order for them to be life-long learners.

Some of the existing signature programmes in 2020 are highlighted below:

### Elective Modules (EM) & Advanced Elective Modules (AEM)

Our school offers Elective Modules (EM) to all our Sec 3 NT students and Advanced Elective Modules (AEM) to Sec 3 Express and NA students every year in collaboration with ITE and various polytechnics respectively.  Each cohort of students gets to choose from a range of EMs and AEMs available depending on their interests and the courses will be confirmed once there is sufficient demand.  The modules extend and build on the learning of existing school subjects, enrich our school curriculum with more applied learning options and expose our students to possible courses in ITE/polytechnics and career paths.

### Elective Module for 3NT  

In October during Post Exam period, 38 students from 3T1 attended an EM on Motorsports. This EM is a customised STEM and Design programme tailored to help students learn about the workings of car systems and the application of science concepts to cars. There was also a demonstration of daily basic car maintenance such as engine oil checks, battery checks, suspension system and tyre knowledge which was an eye-opener for our students. The students had the opportunity to build and design their own 4WD cars. They also collaborated in groups to design and create the car body shells, and do a presentation on the concept behind each of their designs. Due to the restriction on learning journeys, the students attended a webinar with staff from BMW Singapore to learn more about the motorcar industry and the various job opportunities for them.

### Advanced Elective Module for Sec 3 Express / Normal Academic

Due to Covid-19, all AEMs which would have been hosted at the various polytechnics were unfortunately cancelled for 2020.  

  

Secondary 4 NA / NT ASPIRE Programme
------------------------------------

The ASPIRE Programme was conducted with the objectives of:

*   helping our students peak their performances and be better prepared for their N-Levels
*   providing motivation and encouragement to our students through target setting & self-reflection

This year, the programme was planned to allow for more interaction and bonding between students and their Form Teachers (FTs) as our students were away from school for three months due to circuit breaker implementation. The FTs had time to recap with students their targets set at the start of the year and review with them their current progress. FTs also reinforced that time management can help our students to overcome their weakness in coping with the stress of the upcoming National examinations. Next, an external speaker was engaged to provide a motivation talk, through video conference, to guide our students to cultivate good study skills and better time management. As a finale, the students did reflection on their day’s learning through writing a letter to themselves on the goals & targets set for the upcoming national exams.
