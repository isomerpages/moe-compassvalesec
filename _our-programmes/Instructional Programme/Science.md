#  Science Department



The Science Department aims to develop critical thinking skills, and the ability to make informed decisions about scientific phenomena in our students. The various flagship programmes organised are undergirded by the three domains of the Science Curriculum Framework - (a) Knowledge, Understanding and Application, (b) Skills and Processes and (c) Ethics and Attitudes. Through providing our students with a holistic science education, we hope to imbue a passion for science and research in our students.

The department supports the schoolâ€™s environment education efforts as we aim to develop our students into concerned citizens. We educate them on environmental challenges and raise awareness of the impact of their actions on environmental sustainability. Exposure to the various environmental issues is infused throughout the Science curriculum at all levels, and students have a better understanding of how Science and technology can be used to mitigate the impact of these issues.
