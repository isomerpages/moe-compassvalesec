# Science Department


The Science Department aims to develop critical thinking skills, and the ability to make informed decisions about scientific phenomena in our students. The various flagship programmes organised are undergirded by the three domains of the Science Curriculum Framework - (a) Knowledge, Understanding and Application, (b) Skills and Processes and (c) Ethics and Attitudes. Providing our students with a holistic science education, we hope to imbue a passion for science and research in our students.  

#### Programmes

Our lower secondary students are exposed to Science Pr.Ide (Promising Ideas), an investigative project to help our students find joy in learning science through applying science to improve their everyday lives.Â  In encouraging student-centred inquiry, students are given the autonomy to define a problem they wish to solve in an authentic context. Students engage in scientific research to explore, create and evaluate solutions to their identified problems. Science Pr.Ide culminates in a poster presentation, where students develop their scientific communication skills as they share the science behind their solutions with peers. Through this project, students learnt to collaborate digitally as part of their home-based learning experience as they learn how to function in and contribute to an increasingly technologically-driven society.
