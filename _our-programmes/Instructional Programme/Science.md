The Science Department aims to develop critical thinking skills, and the ability to make informed decisions about scientific phenomena in our students. The various flagship programmes organised are undergirded by the three domains of the Science Curriculum Framework - (a) Knowledge, Understanding and Application, (b) Skills and Processes and (c) Ethics and Attitudes. Providing our students with a holistic science education, we hope to imbue a passion for science and research in our students.  

#### Programmes

Our lower secondary students are exposed to Science Pr.Ide (Promising Ideas), an investigative project to help our students find joy in learning science through applying science to improve their everyday lives.  In encouraging student-centred inquiry, students are given the autonomy to define a problem they wish to solve in an authentic context. Students engage in scientific research to explore, create and evaluate solutions to their identified problems. Science Pr.Ide culminates in a poster presentation, where students develop their scientific communication skills as they share the science behind their solutions with peers. Through this project, students learnt to collaborate digitally as part of their home-based learning experience as they learn how to function in and contribute to an increasingly technologically-driven society.

Science came alive for our Secondary Two students as they explored the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve through a virtual learning journey to learn about the varied benefits and importance of Singapore's natural coastline in ensuring a sustainable future. They also explored the hidden wildlife in the area and understood the interdependence of the flora and fauna in the ecosystem. This allowed students to see the application of scientific concepts learnt in the classroom in the real-world.

The department also strives to develop our students’ scientific interest and talent through participation in externally organised scientific research competitions. In July this year, two teams from Secondary Two participated in the 19th Elementz Science Competition, organised by Anderson Secondary School to generate interest in scientific study through participation in investigative-type projects. The students researched and developed their own hypotheses to investigate, conducted and analysed the findings of their experiments, and finally presented their results through a virtual poster submitted to the organisers for judging. Our North Stars demonstrated a spirit of tenacity and excellence as they navigated the many restrictions brought about by Covid-19 to complete their projects, finally achieving a Gold Award and a Silver Award respectively! In addition, our Gold Award team was the only team in the Lower Secondary Category that was invited to share about their project via a pre-recorded presentation. The teams further refined their projects and submitted them to the Singapore Youth Science Fair 2021 in August, where they managed to clinch an Accomplishment and a Commendation Award.

Our upper secondary students also continue to sharpen their scientific research and communication skills through various competitions. Our school has again done well in the annual 22nd International Elementz Fair 2021 organized by Anderson Serangoon Junior College. The fair aims to provide a platform for upper secondary and junior college students to showcase their science research and prototypes which can contribute to the betterment of society. Out of the 92 teams participating in the Secondary School Category, our two teams won a Bronze Award each.  Our teams also submitted their research projects for the East Zone A\*STAR Science Fair 2021 organized by Victoria Junior College. The fair aims to provide students the experience of conducting an investigative science project and provide students with a platform to share their findings and learn from others.  There were a total of 35 projects submitted for the Secondary School (Open) Category, and one of our teams clinched a Merit Award.

Our Secondary 4 students also demonstrated their higher-order critical thinking abilities through the Singapore Junior Chemistry, Biology and Physics Olympiads, where our students were exposed to novel and challenging questions set at the A-level standard. The students showed tenacity as they continued with their training virtually, meeting frequently online during the circuit breaker period to discuss past-year Olympiad questions. Our North Stars grew in their passion and interest for the subjects as they learnt these subjects at a higher level. Our students strived for excellence and received two Silver Awards, one Bronze Award and one Merit Award in the Chemistry Olympiad.   

Through such rich experiences in both competitions and instructional programmes, our department continuously strives to support our students in their appreciation of the value of Science, promote the joy of learning, and prepare North Stars for the 21st century.

Science Pr.Ide culminates in a poster presentation, where students develop their scientific communication skills as they share the science behind their solutions with peers. Due to the home-based learning period this year, Science Pr.Ide was conducted almost entirely online with the exception of the poster presentation. This indirectly helped our students learn how to function in and contribute to an increasingly technologically-driven society.

A team of secondary two students also participated in ‘Think Big, Youth Science Ambassador Programme’ organised by the Science Centre Singapore in collaboration with Amazon Web Services and the Temasek Foundation. Through a series of mentoring sessions, students were exposed to the Design Thinking Framework, and had the opportunity to embark on various community visits, learning journeys and science communication workshops to work on a community project together. As the programme culminated with a project presentation, the skills learnt through the programme would definitely remain applicable in school, in other community spaces and beyond.

Our upper secondary students have also had the opportunity to showcase their work and excel at various platforms. This year, our school sent two teams to the ‘21st International Elementz Fair’, where they had the opportunity to conduct investigative science projects and design posters to effectively communicate their findings with the larger scientific community. Our students thought of creative ways to apply their scientific knowledge in investigating the use of fruit peels as an alternative energy source and the efficacy of biosorbents in purifying water. A total of 111 teams across secondary schools, junior colleges and schools from the ASEAN region took part in the fair this year, and both teams achieved the Gold Award for their innovative and outstanding projects. Even when the circuit breaker measures were introduced, our students displayed grit and tenacity to finish their projects and presentation over video-conferencing when the change in judging format was announced.

Our Secondary 4 students demonstrated their higher-order critical thinking abilities through the ‘Singapore Junior Biology and Physics Olympiads’, where our students were exposed to novel and challenging questions set at the A-level standard. The students showed tenacity as they continued with their training virtually, meeting frequently online during the circuit breaker period to discuss past-year Olympiad questions. Our North Stars grew in their passion and interest for the subjects as they learnt these subjects at a higher level, and five of them received the Certificate of Merit, whilst one received the Honourable mention in the Biology and Physics Olympiads respectively.

Through such rich experiences in both competitions and learning journeys, our department continuously strives to support and develop our students in their appreciation of the value of Science and related skills, in order to enable them to thrive and achieve success in their future work in our innovation-driven future economy.
