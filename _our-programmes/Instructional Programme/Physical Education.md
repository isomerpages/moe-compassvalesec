In Compassvale Sec School, the Physical Education (PE) curriculum is aimed at enabling our students to demonstrate the physical skills, practices and values to enjoy a lifetime of active and healthy living individually or with others. The curriculum is designed to develop in our students the ability to demonstrate this knowledge and disposition across a variety of sports and provide our students with authentic situations where they can apply what they have learnt so that they can be confident participants in the future.  

In 2021, the journey was quite tumultuous when Safety Management Measures (SMM) impacted the delivery of the PE curriculum. Spanning from individual activities to activities involving a group of 8 students, PE lessons had to pivot according to the SMM and provide meaningful lessons for students.

The school conducted a non-residential Outdoor Adventure Learning (OAL) programme where Sec 2 students are brought to Sembawang Campsite for a series of outdoor activities. These included the experience of new skills which cannot be fulfilled in their PE lessons, such as raft-building, kayaking, and cycling.
