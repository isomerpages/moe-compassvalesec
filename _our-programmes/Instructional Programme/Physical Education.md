In Compassvale Sec School, the Physical Education (PE) curriculum is aimed at enabling our students to demonstrate the physical skills, practices and values to enjoy a lifetime of active and healthy living individually or with others. The curriculum is designed to develop in our students the ability to demonstrate this knowledge and disposition across a variety of sports and provide our students with authentic situations where they can apply what they have learnt so that they can be confident participants in the future.  

In 2021, the journey was quite tumultuous when Safety Management Measures (SMM) impacted the delivery of the PE curriculum. Spanning from individual activities to activities involving a group of 8 students, PE lessons had to pivot according to the SMM and provide meaningful lessons for students.

The school conducted a non-residential Outdoor Adventure Learning (OAL) programme where Sec 2 students are brought to Sembawang Campsite for a series of outdoor activities. These included the experience of new skills which cannot be fulfilled in their PE lessons, such as raft-building, kayaking, and cycling.

Students were thrilled with the experiences that they were offered and especially during this pandemic period, the lessons learnt were invaluable.

In Compassvale Secondary School, the Physical Education (PE) curriculum aims to enable our students to demonstrate the skills, practices and values to enjoy a lifetime of active and healthy living individually or with others. It is designed to develop in our students the ability to demonstrate their skills and values across a variety of sports and provide them with authentic situations where they can apply what they have learnt so that they can be confident participants in the future.

For 2020, PE lessons were impacted due to the pandemic situation. During the circuit breaker period, students attended lessons through Home Based Learning (HBL) and PE lessons were conducted through Student Learning Space (SLS). Students were tasked to keep themselves physically active by challenging themselves to do fitness conditioning at home periodically. Also, Outdoor Education lessons and game concept applications were conducted through SLS to elicit responses and assess students for understanding. 

After the circuit breaker period, PE lessons continued with safety measures in place. With these restrictions, the objectives of PE lessons were mainly to keep students active and also make purposeful connections between students’ learning experience and what they can relate to in the current situation. PE teachers reinforced Physical Health and Fitness content during this period and the importance of staying active and being socially responsible to the people around them. 

Fitness conditioning with safe distancing and small sided games with safety measures were organised in order to keep students active. Badminton and Volleyball were two sports which the students engaged in and students use this period of time to continue to hone their skills in these two sports.
