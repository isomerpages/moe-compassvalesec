The Craft & Technology / Aesthetics Department aims to develop confident learners in critical thinking, curiosity and problem solving dispositions through authentic learning. Through problem-based learning in real life context and hands-on approach, the students learn to make sense, analyse and critique research data and create solutions in response. At the same time, students also gain important skills such as relationship and self-management skills, time management skills, communication skills and working in teams. These values and skills contribute to the holistic development of the student and will serve them well beyond their secondary school years. 

The department is made up of Art, Design & Technology (D&T), Electronics, Nutritional Food Science (NFS) and Music.
