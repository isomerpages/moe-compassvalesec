### English Language Department


In a world characterised by the increasingly dynamic and complex exchange of information and discourse, it is imperative that our North Stars develop vital 21st century competencies which include being able to  read and think critically, and communicate effectively and creatively for a variety of purposes, audiences and contexts (PAC). The English Language and Literature curricula and programmes at CVSS are designed to develop in our students a strong foundation of language competencies, as well as the requisite skills, dispositions and values for them to make a positive impact on the lives of those around them. The department envisions nurturing our students to become future-ready, vibrant and empathetic learners and communicators. Using the thematic approach, our instructional programme develops essential attitudes, dispositions and skills in our students progressively over four to five years.

### Signature Programme in Oracy Skills

Oracy refers to the ability to express oneself fluently and grammatically in speech. It involves the life skills of active listening and effective communication, and is vital to helping students succeed in the workplace and in life. Recognising the importance of oracy, the department has developed a signature programme in oracy skills, which seeks to develop students’ competencies in oral communications progressively over four to five years. Integrated into the English Language and Literature curricula, different aspects of oracy skills are emphasised in each level of study to help students build their confidence and competence in these areas. Varied and engaging activities such as drama and public speaking via podcasts are used to motivate students and enliven learning.

### CVSS Language and Literary Appreciation Programme** 

To extend students’ learning beyond the classroom, the department organised programmes and activities to expose students to a variety of literary experiences and art forms.

  
#### Assembly Programmes

In March 2021, to promote extensive reading, the department organised a segment of an assembly programme for all levels of students to commemorate ‘World Book Day’. Students were introduced to good reads through a video and slides featuring teachers gamely dressed up as book characters. Prizes were awarded for students who correctly answered quiz questions based on the featured books and who were also able to identify the teachers pictured. Students participated enthusiastically in the activity.

#### Enrichment Programme

As part of the NAC Words Go Round programme, our upper secondary Literature students were treated to enrichment sessions conducted by two local writers in March 2021. Marc Nair, a local poet, ran a workshop entitled ‘Instagram Poetry’ and guided students to explore the relationship between the popular social media platform Instagram and poetry, considering community, content and visual culture. Students also had the opportunity to create their own works of poetry during the session, to their great delight.

Another prolific local writer, Yeo Wei Wei, ran a workshop entitled ‘Being Human in the Digital Age’ where she facilitated activities which encouraged thinking about how immersion in social media has conditioned people’s thinking and feeling processes, and hence, impacted their development as writers.

To extend their learning beyond the classroom and further deepen their learning of oracy skills, the Secondary 3 students went through a public speaking enrichment workshop conducted by Ko’ach Training and Development group. In spite of the constraints of covid-19 restrictions, students acquired a range of useful tips and handles for crafting and making more engaging speech presentations over two sessions held in April and in October.

### EL Structured Reading Programme

Piloted in 2018, the EL Structured Reading Programme (SRP) is ongoing to help keep students up-to-date with global current affairs and further hone their reading skills. On selected weeks in each term, department teachers specially curated news articles and designed post-reading activities to enhance students’ reading experience, making it more meaningful and purposeful. It is certainly heartening to witness students and teachers engaged in rich classroom discussions centred on the articles.

On 15 July 2021, SRP was also implemented for a good cause. The school participated in Read for Books – a charity book drive in partnership with the National Library Board – aimed at raising awareness and sharing the gift of reading with the less privileged. For every 10 people who read for 15 minutes, one book will be donated to selected beneficiaries. Thus, as students engaged in reading the SRP articles, they were doing so for a good cause.

### Student Achievements

The department believes it is important to provide interested students with opportunities to extend their learning beyond the classroom and to deepen their skills as well as appreciation of language and literature, through participation in a range of suitable competitions.

#### National Schools Literature Festival 2021

Collaboratively organised by teachers from various schools with support from organisations including MOE, NIE, NAC and Singapore Book Council, NSLF is a literary festival for students in Singapore and has provided a powerful platform to develop students’ passion and love for literature.

Our North Stars did the school proud at the 2021 National Schools Literature Festival (NSLF) by clinching the Gold Award in the Choral Speaking segment. This segment of the competition requires teams to perform a coordinated reading of a chosen poem, in a way that shows meaningful interpretation, showcases good oracy skills, and in a way which is also engaging and entertaining. This is the first year in which the Choral Speaking segment included a virtual format, in view of the covid-19 restrictions. The school opted for this format and submitted a video of the students’ choral speaking performance, recorded over a video conferencing platform.

n addition, students were fielded for the Flash Fiction category, and also the Unseen Poetry Debates category of the competition for the first time. Although we did not manage to attain an award in these categories, it was heartening to witness the students experiencing immense growth in their journey of preparing for and participating in this year’s competition.

#### Other Competitions

The other competitions students took part in include the Orators’ Trophy, an inter-school public speaking competition organised by the Anglo-Chinese Junior College Debate Club, as well as the Science Chronicles 2021, a science fiction writing competition organised by the Science Centre Singapore. 

Although not all students went home with awards in these competitions, a key takeaway was seeing many of them emerge from these experiences feeling enriched, inspired and more confident about their abilities.

### Teacher Development


Our team of teachers are committed to continually enhancing our pedagogy and deepening our subject mastery. In 2021, our subject-based EL Professional Learning Team (PLT) embarked on a project to develop a lesson package for the teaching of grammar using an inquiry-based approach, and incorporating multi-literacies, an important focus area in the EL Syllabus 2020. The Literature PLT also worked closely together to enhance the design of alternative assessment tasks and explored strategies to scaffold meaning-making and to enhance learner engagement with the literary texts. The study will be continued next year with both teams also looking into the effective adoption of e-pedagogy for more effective teaching and learning.
