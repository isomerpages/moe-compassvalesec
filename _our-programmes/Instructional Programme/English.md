### English Language Department


In a world characterised by the increasingly dynamic and complex exchange of information and discourse, it is imperative that our North Stars develop vital 21st century competencies which include being able to  read and think critically, and communicate effectively and creatively for a variety of purposes, audiences and contexts (PAC). The English Language and Literature curricula and programmes at CVSS are designed to develop in our students a strong foundation of language competencies, as well as the requisite skills, dispositions and values for them to make a positive impact on the lives of those around them. The department envisions nurturing our students to become future-ready, vibrant and empathetic learners and communicators. Using the thematic approach, our instructional programme develops essential attitudes, dispositions and skills in our students progressively over four to five years.

### Signature Programme in Oracy Skills

Oracy refers to the ability to express oneself fluently and grammatically in speech. It involves the life skills of active listening and effective communication, and is vital to helping students succeed in the workplace and in life. Recognising the importance of oracy, the department has developed a signature programme in oracy skills, which seeks to develop students’ competencies in oral communications progressively over four to five years. Integrated into the English Language and Literature curricula, different aspects of oracy skills are emphasised in each level of study to help students build their confidence and competence in these areas. Varied and engaging activities such as drama and public speaking via podcasts are used to motivate students and enliven learning.

### CVSS Language and Literary Appreciation Programme** 

To extend students’ learning beyond the classroom, the department organised programmes and activities to expose students to a variety of literary experiences and art forms.

  
#### Assembly Programmes

In March 2021, to promote extensive reading, the department organised a segment of an assembly programme for all levels of students to commemorate ‘World Book Day’. Students were introduced to good reads through a video and slides featuring teachers gamely dressed up as book characters. Prizes were awarded for students who correctly answered quiz questions based on the featured books and who were also able to identify the teachers pictured. Students participated enthusiastically in the activity.

#### Enrichment Programme

As part of the NAC Words Go Round programme, our upper secondary Literature students were treated to enrichment sessions conducted by two local writers in March 2021. Marc Nair, a local poet, ran a workshop entitled ‘Instagram Poetry’ and guided students to explore the relationship between the popular social media platform Instagram and poetry, considering community, content and visual culture. Students also had the opportunity to create their own works of poetry during the session, to their great delight.

Another prolific local writer, Yeo Wei Wei, ran a workshop entitled ‘Being Human in the Digital Age’ where she facilitated activities which encouraged thinking about how immersion in social media has conditioned people’s thinking and feeling processes, and hence, impacted their development as writers.

To extend their learning beyond the classroom and further deepen their learning of oracy skills, the Secondary 3 students went through a public speaking enrichment workshop conducted by Ko’ach Training and Development group. In spite of the constraints of covid-19 restrictions, students acquired a range of useful tips and handles for crafting and making more engaging speech presentations over two sessions held in April and in October.
