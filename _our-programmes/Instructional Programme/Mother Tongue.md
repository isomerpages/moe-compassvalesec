# Mother Tongue Department


CVSS Mother Tongue Department aims to provide interesting learning experiences so that our North Stars get to experience and discover a whole realm of new knowledge, and appreciate their own culture and roots. In addition, we hope to provide learning opportunities where our North Stars get to hone their language skills so that they become effective and competent users of their Mother Tongue languages.

#### Chinese New Year

In view of the current Covid-19 situation, the Mother Tongue Department put up a series of activities to usher in the year of the Ox together with our North Stars in the classrooms. These activities included a Paper-cutting activity, a Kahoot! game on Chinese culture, as well as CNY well-wishes videos produced by our staff and the Videography CCA. The school was also treated to a spectacular pre-recorded dance performance put up by the Singapore Chinese Dance Theatre. Even though we were not able to celebrate the festive season together in the school hall, our North Stars had fun immersing themselves in the festivities.
