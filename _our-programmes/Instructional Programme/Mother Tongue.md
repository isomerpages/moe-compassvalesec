# Mother Tongue Department


CVSS Mother Tongue Department aims to provide interesting learning experiences so that our North Stars get to experience and discover a whole realm of new knowledge, and appreciate their own culture and roots. In addition, we hope to provide learning opportunities where our North Stars get to hone their language skills so that they become effective and competent users of their Mother Tongue languages.

#### Chinese New Year

In view of the current Covid-19 situation, the Mother Tongue Department put up a series of activities to usher in the year of the Ox together with our North Stars in the classrooms. These activities included a Paper-cutting activity, a Kahoot! game on Chinese culture, as well as CNY well-wishes videos produced by our staff and the Videography CCA. The school was also treated to a spectacular pre-recorded dance performance put up by the Singapore Chinese Dance Theatre. Even though we were not able to celebrate the festive season together in the school hall, our North Stars had fun immersing themselves in the festivities.

#### MT Enrichment Programme 

The MT Department conducted enrichment programmes for all our lower secondary students in Term 1. To develop our North Stars’ interest in the language through engaging activities and to allow them to develop a greater understanding of Chinese idioms, the students took part in the “Joy of Learning Chinese Language through Chinese Idioms” programme. In conjunction with Chinese New Year, the students also learnt idioms related to the Ox. In addition, our Secondary 1 North Star Malay students participated in Tanjak Making, where they learnt the history behind the tanjak (traditional Malay headgear for men). Students got to deepen their understanding of aspects of the Malay culture involving the tanjak. Each student also learnt the steps to fold their own tanjak and brought the product home. The Secondary 2 Malay students were exposed to traditional Malay calligraphy known as Jawi, which is still widely used in neighbouring countries such as Brunei Darussalam and Malaysia. During the workshop, our North Stars were given an introduction to and explanation of Jawi calligraphy. They, too, brought home an item from the activity: a canvas pouch on which they had designed their names in Jawi.
