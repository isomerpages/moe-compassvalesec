### National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)

The NDLP was launched in 2020 to strengthen students’ digital literacy at different stages of their education journey, from primary schools to the Institutes of Higher Learning. Students acquire digital skills required to navigate the digital age through four mutually reinforcing components in the ‘Find, Think, Apply and Create’ framework.

**Personalised Digital Learning Programme** (PDLP) is initiated by MOE in 2021 to support NDLP and is implemented across all secondary schools. The programme aims to enhance teaching and learning; support self-directed and collaborative learning; and support the development of digital competencies. As our students become more self-directed, collaborative and digitally skilled, they can thrive in an increasingly interconnected and digitalised, diverse and rapidly changing world.  

### Personal Learning Device (PLD)
Under PDLP, each secondary school student will be equipped with a PLD (CVSS has selected the option of a laptop) for learning in class and after school. The PLDs will be used in tandem with educational technologies such as the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS), Student ICON and Google Suite of apps.  The PLDs provide an immersive environment for students to develop the dispositions, knowledge and skills to thrive in the digital environment.  To ensure proper use of the PLDs, they will come with built in Digital Management Application (DMA) which allows the school and parents to determine settings to control usage of the PLDs and screen time.
