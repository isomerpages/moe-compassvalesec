# Craft and Technology Department

### Art  
In line with MOE’s aim of art education to enable every child to enjoy art, communicate visually and to make meaningful connections, the Art Department strives to provide our students with an enjoyable art making experience and to develop their life-long interest in Art. 

Our Secondary 1 curriculum is based on the fundamentals - Art Elements, in which learning is facilitated through various art projects that expose our students to a variety of art crafts, medium and techniques. This spirals into more complex art projects in Secondary 2, where students will further explore Design Concepts and Principles, incorporating and applying the Art Elements they have learnt in the previous year.   
  
In addition to the planned school curriculum, there are post-exam enrichment programmes that provide more opportunities for our students to learn beyond our planned curriculum and thereby increase art appreciation, including real-world applications. These programmes are specially crafted and selected based on the interests of the students in each cohort.  
  

### Design & Technology (D&T)

Design and Technology is taught to all lower secondary students and is an elective subject for the upper secondary students. The vision of the CVSS D&T unit is to develop North Stars into creative and critical thinkers with agentive minds capable of communicating effectively through sketching and 3D-manipulation of resistant materials, i.e. designerly dispositions. Designerly dispositions, as defined in the 2017 D&T Teaching and Learning Syllabus, are: (a) to embrace uncertainties and complexities; (b) to provide plausible solutions to ill-defined real-world problems; (c) keenness to find out how things work and (d) be able to communicate their ideas and designs effectively through verbal and non-verbal modes, ie. sketches and modelling using resistant materials.

The CVSS curriculum engages the North Stars in experiential and hands-on activities to develop their problem-solving and creative thinking skills. The lower secondary D&T curriculum focuses on developing the students’ sketching doodling and sketching ability through the ideation process. Practical skills needed for the construction of the chosen design for the three resistant materials – wood, plastics, and metal – are also included in the teacher-structured design integrative projects that are age-appropriate to their level. In doing so, it provides opportunities for the lower secondary students to think and intervene creatively through the Design Process and the six essential dimensions of D&T learning: basic design, basic technology, project-driven knowledge and skills, design thinking, doodling and sketching, and manipulation. The upper secondary D&T curriculum focuses on fine-tuning the students’ creativity and innovation through the different stages in the Design Process via the student-initiated projects to allow them to acquire the skills and tacit knowledge required for the successful completion of their coursework in their final year. 

The affordances of technology such as Computer-Aided Design(CAD) software, Laser cutting technology, and 3D printing technology are harnessed within the D&T curriculum and the department’s signature program, The Makers Faire, to support the North Stars in their learning and also to keep them abreast of the latest current technology in engineering. 

Within the curriculum, the CAD program (SolidWorks) supports the lower students in their visualisation of the orthographic view of objects for the teaching of design communication. At the upper secondary, SolidWorks is used in the modelling, refinement, and production of technical drawings for the realization of their chosen design. Laser Cutting Technology and 3D printers are used in the production of customized parts/hardware that are not readily available on the market. With assistance from staff, students are also capable of using these technologies to manufacture intricate parts, which would otherwise be too challenging to make using typical tools and machinery available in the workshop, and to use these parts in design and/or engineering-related competitions.

Through the Maker’s Faire, the North Stars have the opportunity to be makers in designing and prototyping ideas with the use of SolidWorks, 3D printing technology, and circuit design software. The program aims to harness the creative and inquisitive nature of the North Stars, and to develop the problem-solving approach and engineering design skills required to effectively communicate their design intent. This fosters a strong appreciation of the contribution technology makes to our daily lives. The North Stars will be engaged in self-directed learning and time management while working on their mini-design projects and coursework within their curriculum. They can assess and hone the skills acquired in both subjects through their participation at national level design and/or engineering-related competitions organised by the Institutes of Higher Learning.
