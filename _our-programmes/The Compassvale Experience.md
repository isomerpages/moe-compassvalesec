We want our students to **Learn and Excel**.&nbsp; We achieve this through engaging, authentic learning experiences designed by our teachers.&nbsp; We leverage technology, and ground learning experience design on subject disciplinarity and real-world applications.&nbsp; Students explore connections between different disciplines, examine local and global issue to appreciate diversity, and develop 21st century competencies.&nbsp; In doing so, we cultivate in them learning dispositions of curiosity, self-directedness and resilience.&nbsp; This will ensure they become lifelong learners who are globally competent.

We want our students to **Grow and Serve** the community as upright, compassionate leaders who make a positive difference.  We develop a strong moral compass in our students through a values-based curriculum.  This develops their empathy, and agency to serve and lead within and beyond the school community.  We are also intentional in our efforts to promote student well-being through experiential and reflective school practices.

Our teachers **Lead and Impact** both their students and the fraternity.&nbsp; We empower our teachers through lifelong learning programmes, collaborative and stakeholder partnerships, so that they remain competent, future-oriented, and reflective amidst changes to the local and global landscapes.&nbsp; Our teachers actively contribute best practices to the fraternity, a testament of the quality of teaching and learning, and student development practices in the school.
