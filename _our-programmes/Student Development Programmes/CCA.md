In Compassvale Secondary School, the main objectives of CCA are to:

*   promote character development and school values
*   promote social integration&nbsp;
*   develop leadership potential
*   provide extended engagement in aesthetic and physical activities
*   enhance individual excellence

As an integral part of our students’ holistic development, various CCA programmes provide platforms for students to discover their interests and talents outside academic pursuits.&nbsp;

  

2021 continued to be a testing year for all co-curricular programmes with the development of the global pandemic.&nbsp; Despite these challenges, all CCAs adapted their activity sessions between various in-person and online formats.&nbsp; Some of them even attained remarkable results.&nbsp; For example, the performing arts such as the Concert Band, Drama and Modern Dance achieved Certificates of Accomplishment / Distinction in the biennial Singapore Arts Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation. In addition, the Aeronautics Club participated in the Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition and clinched the top position in various categories Furthermore,the Environment Club also did well in the 2021 Crea8 Sustainability Re-Crea8 Competition, where they were champion in the Lower Secondary Category.&nbsp; As CVSS moves forward into the new year, we hope to provide our students with more activities and opportunities to continue to pursue holistic development in a safe way.

### 2020

In CVSS, the main objectives of CCA are:

*   To promote character development and school values
*   To promote social integration&nbsp;
*   To develop leadership potential
*   To provide extended engagement in aesthetic and physical activities
*   To enhance individual excellence

As an integral part of our students’ holistic development, various CCA programmes provide platforms for students to discover their interests and talents outside academic pursuits. The Sports CCAs develop robustness, fair play and team spirit among students. The Performing Arts CCAs instil in students a sense of graciousness and an appreciation of the aesthetics. The Uniformed Group activities inculcate in students self-reliance, resilience, discipline and a spirit of service to the community. The Clubs and Societies allow students to explore and extend their interest in areas which may be knowledge or skill-based.

2020 has been a challenging year for CCAs in CVSS.&nbsp; While all CCAs were ready to get into full swing from February, the outbreak of the global pandemic halted various programmes, and subsequent pandemic management measures also limited opportunities for students to achieve similar objectives through other activities. However, the school worked to introduce measures to allow students to achieve similar learning opportunities even with safety restrictions. In Semester 2, CCA programmes continued to engage students via e-CCA, which was similar to home-based learning. By Term 4, most CCAs had resumed face-to-face sessions, with safety measures in place to ensure social distancing. As CVSS moves forward into the new year, with Phase 3 measures being implemented, we hope to bring more activities and opportunities to our students, while continuing to prioritise everyone’s safety. Although 2020 provided its share of difficulty, we have weathered these challenges and will move forward as a community to the fairer shores of 2021.
