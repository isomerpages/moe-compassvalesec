The Student Development Team (SDT) aims to promote the holistic development and well-being of all students by:

1.  Delivering a student-centric and values-driven education through age-appropriate programmes and strategies to support the holistic development of all students;
    
2.  Enhancing the quality of school experience for students, with greater emphasis on, and attention to, values education and students’ social emotional needs and development; 
    
3.  Creating a caring and enabling school culture, where all all members of the school community feel safe and cared for, have a sense of belonging to the school, and feel connected to one another.
