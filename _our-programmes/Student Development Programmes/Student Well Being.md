### Student Well-Being

The Student Development Team (SDT) aims to promote the holistic development and well-being of all students by providing thoughtfully-curated programmes that are aligned to the school motto of ‘Realising the Star Within’&nbsp;and the North Star Education Programme (NSEP). With its focus on student-centricity, the SDT designs specific learning experiences to meet the developmental needs of our North Stars at each level, and seeks to provide varied and authentic opportunities for our North Stars to develop their character, social-emotional competencies and emerging 21st Century Competencies.

### The STAR Programme

In the last week of Term 1, our North Stars went through our signature STAR 1 programme. Focusing on student development, this programme was based on the STAR theme: Seek out My Strength; Take Responsibility; Adopt an Enterprising Spirit; Ready for the World. Different activities were planned around these themes, although they had to be scaled down as most of the activities had to be confined to interactions within the class, in keeping with the existing Covid-19 Safe Management Measures.  
  

##### Secondary 1

To help our Secondary Ones seek out their strengths, they were put through TetraMap profiling, where they discovered their personal and inter-personal strengths. This experience helped participants identify the element that best describes them and their classmates, enabling them to identify classmates of similar strengths and to learn how to interact with classmates with different personalities. Moreover, the form teachers led the students through a reflection process to gain better self-awareness by reviewing the results of their Social-Emotional Competencies Inventory survey. The Secondary Ones also learnt to take responsibility as leaders through The Leadership Challenge workshop.&nbsp;

&nbsp;  

##### Secondary 2  

In an endeavour to take responsibility for themselves and their environment, the Secondary 2 students experienced three and a half days of activities to learn more about themselves and their role in the larger world. On the first day of STAR 1, the Secondary 2 students learnt crucial environment saving skills from a series of Upcycling workshops. On top of taking responsibility for the environment, the students also ventured into outdoor spaces and learnt to adopt an enterprising attitude towards new challenges. As they participated in the Outdoors Non-Residential Adventure activities in Sembawang Park and all over the Northern region of Singapore, the Secondary Twos challenged themselves to accomplish tasks and solve problems in both land and water activities. They learnt a variety of skills: camp craft, orienteering, and raft-building. Our students also stepped out of their comfort zones participating in newly included activities such as kayaking and stand up paddling, and cycling. Our Secondary Twos displayed a strong enterprising spirit as they overcame their personal limits and developed confidence.&nbsp;  

  

#####  Secondary 3

For our Secondary Threes, the STAR 1 Programme aimed to provide authentic opportunities for students to adopt an enterprising spirit and resilience in overcoming challenges and willingness to try out new things in new environments. It also enabled the Secondary 3s to rediscover themselves and their interests and strengths through a variety of courses offered. In this four-day programme, the Secondary 3 Normal (Technical) students attended their Elective Module (EM) conducted by ITE College either at ITE College Central itself or in school, whereas the Secondary 3 Normal (Academic) students attended STEM-related EMs conducted by vendors in schools. While the majority of Secondary 3 Express students attended Advanced Elective Modules (AEM) at various polytechnics, a small group attended STEM-related enrichment programme. Through these four&nbsp; days, the students got a taste of tertiary education as they took on hands-on experiments, project planning and presentations, after which the students were assessed on their knowledge of the module. Although it was a steep learning curve for our students, it was an enriching learning experience.  

  

##### Secondary 4 and 5

Our Secondary 4 and 5 North Stars participated in a three-day Ready For The World Programme aimed at equipping them with knowledge, life-skills and attitude to be ready for the world after graduation. The theme on the first day was ‘Discovering Who I Am’, in which our North Stars took part in experiential learning activities and completed the DISC profiling tool to seek out their strengths and learning styles, develop their personal brands, learn interview skills and plan their portfolio to prepare for life after secondary school. ‘Exploring My Education and Career Pathways’ was the theme for the second day on which speakers and alumni from various post-secondary institutions and industries shared with our North Stars about post-secondary course and career options. In addition, our North Stars learnt financial literacy. Furthermore, Secondary 4 students learnt how to make responsible, informed decisions through HPB Sexuality Education eTeens programme. Last but not least, Secondary 5NA students participated in a Pathfinder workshop to chart their education journey and learn ways to open up more possibilities and options.&nbsp;

All in all, our North Stars had many memorable and enriching experiential learning experiences during the entire STAR 1 programme, where many made personal discoveries and stepped out of their comfort zones to embrace new challenges. It was a good break from the usual routines of daily lessons - some made personal discoveries, some bonded with their teachers and peers. Over and above, these experiences will take them one step closer towards finding their compass in life!&nbsp;&nbsp;

  

##### GEAR-UP Programme &amp; After-School Centre&nbsp;&nbsp;

The GEAR-UP Operational Team successfully embarked on the Guiding and Empowering Students for Affiliation and Resilience to Unlock their Potential (GEAR-UP) Programme to support high needs students. It aims to help these students enhance learning motivation, strengthen school connectedness and build resilience through opportunities to grow and contribute back to school via service learning and the GEAR-UP Changemakers leadership programme, as well as other leadership opportunities.&nbsp;

In addition to the regular after-school activities planned for students in our GEAR-UP Programme such as futsal, eSports, yoga and woodworking, the successful implementation and use of the After-School Centre (ASC) have provided a safe, supportive, positive and caring haven for our students. The students also developed positive relationships through the presence of significant adults and positive peer groups.


### North Star's Pledge


The North Star’s Pledge was first implemented in 2017, with a mission to instil a greater sense of ownership and cultivate a strong positive mindset amongst our North Stars. After a year of implementation, recitation and review, 2018 saw a revised version of the pledge that now captures the heart of our school ethos, which is what we hope our North Stars possess. This year, the upper secondary classes took turns to create videos to share their reflections and application of the pledge in their lives. In reciting the pledge every Monday during morning assembly, our North Stars are reminded of the best that they can be – to have a positive disposition towards learning and finding their purpose; to have a mindset of excellence to pursue their personal best; to have the courage to grow and lead meaningful and purposeful lives; and to have the desire to shine and lead the way for others like the immovable, guiding light of a North Star.&nbsp;

# **Pastoral Care**

The Pastoral Care Committee (PS) strives to create and sustain a caring school culture where all members of the school community feel safe and cared for, have a sense of belonging to the school, and feel connected to one another. Such a culture is built upon a solid foundation of quality relationships based on trust, good character, values, and a warm and supportive school environment. Students experience a caring school culture primarily through positive teacher-student relationship (TSR) and peer support and relationship (PSR).

To foster good PSR in the school, the Pastoral Care Committee oversees the selection of suitable students to be peer support leaders (PSLs) and works closely with them throughout the year. Every year, Form Teachers will select two suitable PSLs from each class. PSLs are elected based on qualities of confidence, care and compassion, and the ability to build rapport with people. The Pastoral Care Committee also selects suitable students to be peer support student mentors (PSSMs) to guide and support PSLs in their roles by sharing their experiences and advice. PSSMs are selected from the pool of PSLs from the previous year.

The Pastoral Care Committee helms the PSL and PSSMs training programmes to equip our PSLs and PSSMs with the necessary skills and tools that will help them journey through school life with their peers in school. The selected PSLs will attend PSL training sessions conducted by trained teachers, where they will learn to recognise signs of DISTRESS, Peer Helping Skills (CHEER Model), Basic Attending Skills (SOLER/CROPS Model), Active Listening Skills, and Facilitation Skills. PSLs are trained to be sensitive to behavioural changes and mood swings of their peers and regularly consult their Form Teachers on the well-being of the class. During these training sessions, PSLs will also be involved in activities that require them to communicate with each other creatively through games and role-play as well as prepare care packs for peers in need.

  

With the prevailing safe management measures (SMM) in place, our annual PSL Appreciation Day was conducted online in Semester 2. PSLs were given tokens of appreciation ahead of the online sessions, which were helmed by the Pastoral Care Committee. The peer support teacher mentors (PSTMs) engaged the students in online discussions and activities via Zoom and other platforms. The PSLs and PSTMs had a meaningful time reflecting on their experience as PSLs through this engagement.

During this volatile period, ensuring students’ overall well-being proved significantly more important than ever before. Apart from training the PSLs to support their peers, the Pastoral Care Committee supported the teachers in supporting students’ overall well-being by providing mental wellness packages and conducting talks.  

The Pastoral Care Committee aspires to build an inclusive and supportive school environment that extends to the wider community as the students journey through life.
