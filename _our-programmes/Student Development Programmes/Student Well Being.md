### Student Well-Being

The Student Development Team (SDT) aims to promote the holistic development and well-being of all students by:

1. Delivering a student-centric and values-driven education through age-appropriate programmes and strategies to support the holistic development of every student.

2. Enhancing the quality of students’ school experience by placing greater emphasis on values education and supporting their social-emotional needs and growth. 

3. Fostering a caring and enabling school culture where every member of the school community feels safe, cared for, and connected, with a strong sense of belonging.

Some of the key student well-being programmes that our North Stars experience include: 

* **The STAR Programme** - Develops students’ character, social-emotional competencies and emerging 21st Century Competencies through level-specific student development experiences:

	* Sec 1: Ready for Discovery - Students start right by understanding personal strengths, interest and areas for growth and recognise that everyone is different.

	* Sec 2: Ready for Responsibility - Students understand one’s personal strengths, interest and areas for growth, to choose wisely and make well-informed decisions. They also embrace diversity to build positive and collaborative relationships

	* Sec 3: Ready for the Community - Students understand the various post-secondary and career opportunities available for them.  They gain awareness of the needs of the local community as they step up and strive to meet their needs.

	* Sec 4/5: Ready for the World - Students prepare themselves to enter an identified post-secondary pathway and an aspirational career. They emerge stronger as they gain knowledge of Singapore, Southeast Asia and the world. 

* **Teacher-Student Chats** – Fosters meaningful connections and positive Teacher-Student Relationships. Form Teachers engage students in small groups or one-on-one conversations on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Students can communicate their needs to their form teacher during these sessions, receive advice on making education and career choices, as well as feedback on character development. 

* **CARE**: 
	* Our Counselling Team provides a safe environment for students to share their challenges and work through social, emotional, behavioural and mental health issues. We help them learn and use strategies to manage and cope with their emotions or situation. Students may be referred to the School Counsellor by their teacher or they may approach our School Counsellor for support.

	* Our Special Educational Needs (SEN) Team works closely with teachers, parents and external partners to support students with diverse learning needs. We focus on building access, understanding and confidence by providing classroom accommodations, targeted strategies and socio-emotional support. The team also advocates for inclusive practices across the school. One such platform is the annual Purple Parade Carnival which aims to promotes inclusion and celebrates the abilities and contributions of persons with disabilities.

* **The Guiding and Empowering Students for Affiliation and Resilience to Unlock their Potential (GEAR-UP) Programme**  - The year-long programme, comprising weekly activities and leadership opportunities to guide high needs students to find a place in the community. Teachers helming this programme support students throughout their 4-year secondary school journey in terms of their socio-emotional wellbeing, and their learning of self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship management and responsible decision-making. The After School Centre is also within the purview of the GEAR-UP programme, providing a safe space for students to engage in recreational activities or self-study.
