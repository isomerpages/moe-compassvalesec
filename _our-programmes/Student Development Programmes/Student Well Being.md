### Student Well-Being

The Student Development Team (SDT) aims to promote the holistic development and well-being of all students by:

1. Delivering a student-centric and values-driven education through age-appropriate programmes and strategies to support the holistic development of every student.

2. Enhancing the quality of students’ school experience by placing greater emphasis on values education and supporting their social-emotional needs and growth. 

3. Fostering a caring and enabling school culture where every member of the school community feels safe, cared for, and connected, with a strong sense of belonging.
