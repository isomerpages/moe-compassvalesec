            **Student Leadership Committee**

At CVSS, we believe in developing the leadership potential of each student so that they can become World Ready Youth. As our students “Serve to Lead, Lead to Inspire”, they grow to become confident, self-directed 21st Century leaders who Model the Way, Inspire a Shared Vision, Challenge the Process, Enable Others to Act and Encourage the Heart.

Student Leadership development in CVSS is guided by our Student Leadership Framework, MOE’s 21st Century Competencies Framework, and The Leadership Challenge by Kouzes and Posner. All students are equipped with a basic understanding of The Leadership Challenge (TLC) model through the TLC Workshop, and, depending on their readiness, embark on various authentic leadership opportunities in Class, CCA and the school to grow as leaders who serve, lead and inspire.
