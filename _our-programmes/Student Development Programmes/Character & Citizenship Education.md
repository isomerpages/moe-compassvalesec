# Character and Citizenship Education Department
  
The Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Department aims to instil in our North Stars core values that will serve as the foundation for their character and provide a compass for their conduct. The department aims to grow the social and emotional competencies of our North Stars to be able to manage themselves and their relationships more effectively as well as to make responsible decisions in their lives. In addition, we develop in our students the 21st Century skills so as to prepare them to be ready for the world beyond their secondary school years. We also seek to nurture our students’ citizenship skills and attitudes so that they can contribute actively as concerned citizens and remain rooted to Singapore. These goals are realised by engaging our North Stars though the Head, Heart and Hands Approach via our CCE lessons, department and school-wide programmes. 

  

**Signature Programme:**

*   Ready For The World (for Secondary 4 and 5 students)
    

In line with our school’s motto - “World Ready Youth”, the department organised its annual three-day seminar to equip our North Stars with the necessary life skills to thrive in life after graduation. Each day of the seminar focused on important themes to help our students develop important skills and values that will help them navigate through and make the best of their lives. These include components such as understanding their personality and learning styles, exploring viable post-secondary options, making informed decisions and developing plans to do well in their personal life, citizenship, character and academic pursuits as well as learning financial literacy skills to help students to be ready for the world.

  

### Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Programme

**

In the ECG programme, a whole-school approach is adopted to equip our students with the knowledge, values and skills on education and career matters so that they can make informed decisions as they work towards their aspirations. Through customised student development experiences, students are engaged to discover their interests and passions, gain greater awareness and understanding of tertiary courses and trending industries and develop the necessary skills needed for future world of work. In addition, teachers are equipped with ECG facilitation skills and play a pivotal role in helping students connect their academic and co-curricular experiences with their education and career goals. With the support from our ECG counsellor and partnership with various tertiary institutions, our students are provided with opportunities to participate in online ECG events and workshops. 

  
**Key Programmes: **

*   Annual ECG seminar
    
*   Dialogue sessions with School Advisory Committee (SAC) members
    
*   Learning journeys to post-secondary institutions 
    
*   Workshops and talks such as Early Admissions Exercise (EAE) Talks/workshops, Direct School Admission (DSA) for Junior College talks, 12 Choices Talk
    

**G2R3IT Values Programme**

The G2R3IT Values Programme aims to instil the values of Graciousness, Gratitude, Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity and Teamwork through a series of activities aligned to 3 domains, namely Practice, Develop and Affirm. 

**Key Programmes:**

*   Values Sharing - Class CCE Ambassadors facilitate discussions with their classmates on how they could conscientiously practice the value of the semester. 
    

*   Keep CVSS Clean Movement - Class Environment Champions lead their classmates to maintain the cleanliness and tidiness of their learning spaces and other shared spaces. 
    

*   Character Growth Chart - North Stars assess themselves and reflect on their personal growth in demonstrating the school values by setting targets and working towards them 
    
*   School Values Award - Students are given a voice to affirm and nominate their peers for exemplifying the school values consistently in their class and CCAs at the end of each semester. Through this initiative, we hope to affirm the recipients to inspire their peers and encourage more students to live out our school values every day. 
    
All in all, with regular opportunities for students to practice, develop and affirm the G2R3IT Values over the year, our North Stars grow and glow in good character.
