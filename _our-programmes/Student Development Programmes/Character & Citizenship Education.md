# Character and Citizenship Education Department
  
The goal of CCE is to inculcate values and build competencies in our students to develop them to be good individuals and useful citizens.  
In order to achieve this, the department continues in its approach to engage our North Stars via the head, hands and heart approach.

### Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Department

The Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Department aims to instil in our North Stars core values that will serve as the foundation for their character and provide a compass for their conduct. The department aims to grow the social and emotional competencies of our North Stars to be able to manage themselves and their relationships more effectively as well as to make responsible decisions in their lives. In addition, we develop in our students the 21st Century skills so as to prepare them to be ready for the world beyond their secondary school years. We also seek to nurture our students’ citizenship skills and attitudes so that they can contribute actively as concerned citizens and remain rooted to Singapore. These goals are realised by engaging our North Stars though the Head, Heart and Hands Approach via our CCE lessons, department and school-wide programmes.   
  

### Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Programme

The ECG programme adopts a whole-school approach to equip our students with the knowledge, values and skills on education and career choices so that they can make informed decisions as they work towards their aspirations. Through customised student development experiences such as our annual ECG Seminar, CCE lessons, teacher-student conferencing sessions, learning journeys, workshops and talks, students are engaged to discover their interests and passions, gain greater awareness and understanding of tertiary courses and industries and develop the necessary skills needed for future world of work. In addition, teachers are equipped with ECG facilitation skills and play a pivotal role in helping students connect their academic and co-curricular experiences with their education and career goals. With the support from our ECG counsellor and partnership with various tertiary institutions, our students are provided with  opportunities to participate in online ECG events such as the Early Admissions Exercise (EAE) Talk by Temasek and Republic Polytechnic, Direct School Admission (DSA) for Junior College by Tampines Meridian Junior College, 12 Choices Talk by Temasek Polytechnic and the Polytechnic Foundation Programme (PFP) and Direct Entry Scheme to Polytechnic Programme (DPP) by Singapore Polytechnic.
