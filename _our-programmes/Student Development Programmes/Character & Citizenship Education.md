### Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Department

The Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Department aims to instil in our North Stars core values that will serve as the foundation for their character and provide a compass for their conduct. The department aims to grow the social and emotional competencies of our North Stars to be able to manage themselves and their relationships more effectively as well as to make responsible decisions in their lives. In addition, we develop in our students the 21st Century skills so as to prepare them to be ready for the world beyond their secondary school years. We also seek to nurture our students’ citizenship skills and attitudes so that they can contribute actively as concerned citizens and remain rooted to Singapore. These goals are realised by engaging our North Stars though the Head, Heart and Hands Approach via our CCE lessons, department and school-wide programmes.   
  

### Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Programme

The ECG programme adopts a whole-school approach to equip our students with the knowledge, values and skills on education and career choices so that they can make informed decisions as they work towards their aspirations. Through customised student development experiences such as our annual ECG Seminar, CCE lessons, teacher-student conferencing sessions, learning journeys, workshops and talks, students are engaged to discover their interests and passions, gain greater awareness and understanding of tertiary courses and industries and develop the necessary skills needed for future world of work. In addition, teachers are equipped with ECG facilitation skills and play a pivotal role in helping students connect their academic and co-curricular experiences with their education and career goals. With the support from our ECG counsellor and partnership with various tertiary institutions, our students are provided with  opportunities to participate in online ECG events such as the Early Admissions Exercise (EAE) Talk by Temasek and Republic Polytechnic, Direct School Admission (DSA) for Junior College by Tampines Meridian Junior College, 12 Choices Talk by Temasek Polytechnic and the Polytechnic Foundation Programme (PFP) and Direct Entry Scheme to Polytechnic Programme (DPP) by Singapore Polytechnic.

### Ready For the World Programme (for Secondary 4 and 5 students)  

In line with our school’s motto of “World Ready Youth”, the department organised its annual three-day seminar to equip our North Stars with the necessary life skills to thrive in life after graduation. Each day of the seminar focused on important themes to help our students develop important skills and values that will help them navigate through and make the best of their lives. These include components such as understanding their personality and learning styles, exploring viable post-secondary options, making informed decisions and developing plans to do well in their personal life, citizenship, character and academic pursuits as well as learning financial literacy skills to help students to be ready for the world.

  

External speakers from various institutions and industries are invited to speak to the students to enable them to gain a better understanding of the job scopes of various occupations and allow them to consider their post-secondary options. These institutions/ industries include Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, Singapore Hotel Association, SingHealth, Media, Singapore Psychological Society and Anderson Serangoon Junior College. 

  

Our students also attended numerous talks organised by the department. The Secondary 4 Normal (Academic) students attended zoom workshops conducted by Temasek Polytechnic. In addition, the Secondary 4 Express and Secondary 5 Normal (Academic) students participated in e-course advising with Nanyang Polytechnic lecturers. Furthermore, the Secondary 4 Normal (Technical) students embarked on a learning journey to the Lifelong Learning Institute. Moreover, a compilation of webinars from various post-secondary institutions was also made available for parents to learn more about the different pathways for their children. Students also participated in the L Cube Workshop by Temasek Polytechnic Smart Programme which provided an opportunity for them to experience the making of education, career and financial decisions in a fun and risk-free setting.
