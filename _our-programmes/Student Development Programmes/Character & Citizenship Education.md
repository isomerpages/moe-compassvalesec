### Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Department

The Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Department aims to instil in our North Stars core values that will serve as the foundation for their character and provide a compass for their conduct. The department aims to grow the social and emotional competencies of our North Stars to be able to manage themselves and their relationships more effectively as well as to make responsible decisions in their lives. In addition, we develop in our students the 21st Century skills so as to prepare them to be ready for the world beyond their secondary school years. We also seek to nurture our students’ citizenship skills and attitudes so that they can contribute actively as concerned citizens and remain rooted to Singapore. These goals are realised by engaging our North Stars though the Head, Heart and Hands Approach via our CCE lessons, department and school-wide programmes.   
  

### Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Programme

The ECG programme adopts a whole-school approach to equip our students with the knowledge, values and skills on education and career choices so that they can make informed decisions as they work towards their aspirations. Through customised student development experiences such as our annual ECG Seminar, CCE lessons, teacher-student conferencing sessions, learning journeys, workshops and talks, students are engaged to discover their interests and passions, gain greater awareness and understanding of tertiary courses and industries and develop the necessary skills needed for future world of work. In addition, teachers are equipped with ECG facilitation skills and play a pivotal role in helping students connect their academic and co-curricular experiences with their education and career goals. With the support from our ECG counsellor and partnership with various tertiary institutions, our students are provided with  opportunities to participate in online ECG events such as the Early Admissions Exercise (EAE) Talk by Temasek and Republic Polytechnic, Direct School Admission (DSA) for Junior College by Tampines Meridian Junior College, 12 Choices Talk by Temasek Polytechnic and the Polytechnic Foundation Programme (PFP) and Direct Entry Scheme to Polytechnic Programme (DPP) by Singapore Polytechnic.

### Ready For the World Programme (for Secondary 4 and 5 students)  

In line with our school’s motto of “World Ready Youth”, the department organised its annual three-day seminar to equip our North Stars with the necessary life skills to thrive in life after graduation. Each day of the seminar focused on important themes to help our students develop important skills and values that will help them navigate through and make the best of their lives. These include components such as understanding their personality and learning styles, exploring viable post-secondary options, making informed decisions and developing plans to do well in their personal life, citizenship, character and academic pursuits as well as learning financial literacy skills to help students to be ready for the world.

### CVSS Kindness Movement (Project G)

The CVSS Kindness Movement aims to encourage students to demonstrate acts of kindness to the people around them. Due to the pandemic, Singapore has seen many challenges, changes and uncertainties. The department recognises that while many of our students may be affected by Covid-19 pandemic, there are silver linings in their lives which they should seek and learn to appreciate about. The CVSS Kindness Movement, through Project G, aims to encourage our North Stars to be gracious and grateful to their loved ones such as their parents, grandparents, and guardians who have supported them in various stages of their lives. Through this project, students folded paper cranes and penned words of gratitude to their loved ones as well as words of hope and well-wishes for the community and Singapore.

### Values-in-Action (VIA) Experiences  

#### CVSS Care in Action, Ready to Serve (CVSS CAReS)

VIA experiences focus on the students’ development as socially responsible citizens who care about and contribute meaningfully to their community and nation. VIA experiences nurture in students a commitment to address concerns, exercise ownership and initiate ways to serve community and nation.

In line with our school’s Learning for Life Programme, ‘Inspired North Stars Inspire Actions’ our students are taught values, equipped with knowledge and skills and are given various platforms to take action. Through these experiential learning opportunities, our students are groomed into youth leaders of the community who create a sustainable impact in school and the community. All in all, CVSS CAReS aims to instill a strong moral compass in our students and nurture them to be World-Ready Youths – innovative contributors, upright citizens with a global outlook.

  

### Signature Programmes


#### Rallying together in midst of COVID-19 pandemic

With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the negative sentiments towards healthcare workers in February, classes came forward to show their gratitude by doing up boards with notes of appreciation and support. These boards were then delivered to Sengkang General and Community Hospitals, and Tan Tock Seng Hospital. During the circuit breaker period with spikes in cases among dormitories, students from 2E4 and 3E4, together with their Form Teachers, produced an appreciation video to thank and cheer up migrant workers who were in quarantine and frontliners for their commitment and dedication.

#### Green Compass Programme 2020

In land scarce Singapore, there is an increasing need to reduce the volume of waste to conserve our landfills. The Green Compass Programme is our annual signature programme to engage and empower our Lower Secondary students to champion environmental ownership by leading, organising and participating in green initiatives to show their passion and commitment towards global and local environmental issues.

  

Secondary 1 students attended a talk on Waste Minimisation in Singapore organised National Environment Agency in January. Secondary 1 VIA Champions conducted a lesson on good recycling practices to their classmates and led them in a campus-wide Recyclable and Reusable collection drive. Students sorted the collected items into paper waste, plastic waste and donatable items namely, clothing, stationeries and school textbooks. Class 1N2 was crowned as the ‘Green Champions 2020’ for their active contribution and enthusiastic participation.

  

Secondary 2 students participated in a virtual tour of the Sustainable Singapore Gallery and created upcycled products such as mask holders, pencil cases and cardholders from milk cartons and plastic banners through live workshops facilitated by TERRA Singapore. Using design thinking, classes created artefacts for use at the canteen, toilets, Art studio and outside the General Office. These were assessed based on their functionality, aesthetics and durability. The aretfacts were displayed in an exhibition as part of the ‘Project Work Learning Festival 2020’.    

  

Besides acquiring knowledge in recycling and upcycling, students have the opportunity to take action and do their part in reducing waste.

#### Service-Learning Projects 2020

In line with our Learning for Life Programme (Community & Youth Leadership), our Secondary 3 students embarked on their class service-learning project with the intention to evoke empathy for the elderly and people with special needs whilst interacting with them meaningfully. Classes were given the autonomy to pick one of our four long term partners, namely SunLove Home, Bright Hill Evergreen Home, Bethesda C.A.R.E Senior Activity Centre and Sengkang Community Hospital and design an engagement activity that addressed the real need that they had identified.

  

With the suspension of volunteers visiting homes, day-care centres and hospitals, students had to modify their plans innovatively to engage their beneficiaries remotely. They, hence, harnessed the power of ICT as a means to carry on their service-learning projects. With the support of the Form Teachers and guidance from mentors from TOUCH Leadership & Mentoring, classes executed a varied range of projects, including virtual performances, interactions through video conferencing platforms, producing tutorial videos and delivering the required logistics. As a means of documenting the learning experience, the Sec 3 Cyberwellness Ambassadors captured snippets of photographs and video clips throughout their service-learning projects and produced vlogs. Shortlisted vlogs were uploaded on the ‘Design For Change Global’ website to inspire and encourage other internet users to participate in voluntary work despite the limitation on suspending physical engagements during this COVID-19 pandemic.
