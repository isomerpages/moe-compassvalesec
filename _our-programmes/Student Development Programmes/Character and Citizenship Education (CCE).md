# Character and Citizenship Education Department
  
The Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Department aims to instil in our North Stars core values that will serve as the foundation for their character and provide a  strong moral compass for their conduct. The department aims to nurture upright, compassionate leaders who serve and contribute to the community. North Stars have the opportunity to develop their social and emotional competencies  so as to be able to manage themselves and their relationships more effectively as well as to make responsible decisions in their lives. In addition, we develop in our students the 21st Century Competencies so as to prepare them to be ready for the world beyond their secondary school years. We also seek to nurture our students’ citizenship skills dispositions and attitudes so that they can contribute actively as concerned citizens and remain rooted to Singapore.

  

**Signature Programme:**

*   Ready For The World (for Secondary 4 and 5 students)
    

In line with our school’s motto vision - “World Ready Youth”, the department organised its annual three-day seminar to equip our North Stars with the necessary life skills to thrive in life after graduation. Each day of the seminar focused on important themes to help our students develop important skills and values that will help them navigate through and make the best of their lives. These include components such as understanding their personality and learning styles, developing their personal brand, building digital portfolio, sharpening interview skills, exploring viable post-secondary options, making informed decisions and developing plans to do well in their personal life, citizenship, character and academic pursuits as well as learning financial literacy skills to help students to be ready for the world upon graduation.
