“National Education aims to develop national cohesion, the instinct for survival and confidence in our future. We must equip them with the basic attitudes, values and instincts which make them Singaporeans. This is the common culture that will give them a shared perception of life, and draw them closer together as one people when confronted with serious problems. This will give them a well-founded faith in the country’s future. ”

*Mr Lee Hsien Loong, Prime Minister<br>
Launch Of National Education<br>
17 May 1997*

As part of the CCE programme, the NE programme acts as a platform for the achievement of the school’s thrust: \`a holistic values-driven learning experience for student-centric meritocracy’. The National Education seeks to provide experiences to support the school in realising its vision ‘World Ready Youths – Innovative contributors, upright citizens with a global outlook’.  The \`Head, Heart and Hands’ approach is deployed in its organisation of Citizenship programmes which will help develop students’ citizenship dispositions through a variety of key Student Development Experiences such as NE Commemorative Days, Cohort Learning Journey and NRIC Presentation Ceremony which will contribute towards the holistic development of all students.

### 5 KEY PILLARS of National Education

1.  Every Singaporean Matters
2.  Strong Families: Our Foundation and Our Future
3.  Opportunities for All
4.  The Singapore Heartbeat: Feeling Passionately About Singapore
5.  Active Citizens - Making a Difference to Society  
      
    

### 6 NATIONAL EDUCATION MESSAGES

1.  Singapore is our homeland; this is where we belong. We treasure our heritage and take pride in shaping our own unique way of life.
2.  We must preserve racial and religious harmony. We value our diversity and are determined to stay a united people.  
3.  We must uphold meritocracy and incorruptibility. We provide opportunities for all, according to their ability and effort.  
4.  No one owes Singapore a living. We find our own way to survive and prosper, turning challenge into opportunity.
5.  We must ourselves defend Singapore. We are proud to defend Singapore ourselves, no one else is responsible for our security and well-being.
6.  We have confidence in our future. United, determined and well-prepared, we have what it takes to build a bright future for ourselves, and to progress together as one nation.

### NE Commemmorative Events


  

#### Total Defence Day 

In line with the theme \`Together We Keep Singapore Strong ‘, a series of activities were organised to commemorate Total Defence this year. These included a CCE lesson that started with a TDD 2021 video Message by Minister of Defence, Dr Ng Eng Hen on his Facebook page. Two reading articles - \`Better workplaces with National Service-friendly policies’ and \`Singaporeans to join forces to battle online radicalisation of young people’ - were prepared to engage the Lower Secondary and Upper Secondary students respectively on security issues.  Through a video Board Game designed by the Singapore Discovery Centre, students realised the importance of resilience as they witnessed the challenges faced by the various characters in the stories of hope and optimism during the Covid-19 pandemic. The CCE Department also worked with the various uniformed group CCAs to set up booths featuring the pillars of Total Defence and the Secondary Three students had the opportunity to learn first aid, play team bonding games and quizzes on work of the various defence forces as they visited the various stations.  A static display on the 6 Pillars of Total Defence and how Singapore fell to the Japanese on the first day of Chinese New Year were put up as this year’s TDD took place during the period of Chinese New Year Celebrations.

This year, for the very first time, Chingay 2021 took on a digital format to rally people from diverse backgrounds to come together as one community and provide a boost to the resilient Singapore spirit one year since the start of the pandemic. Students were taught about what made Singapore unique. There was also a whole school participation component for staff and students to vote for the paths that the main character should take as they met with choices about how they could contribute in a multi-cultural society. The programme ended with students being engaged in multicultural dance moves in their classrooms.

Students were engaged in reading articles about the impact of world events on Singapore such as the blockage of the Suez Canal. Through learning more about the rich diversity of cultures, students also learn to appreciate the spirit of friendship and collaboration, the basis on which Singapore can connect with different countries in the global community. While the Secondary Two to Five students were engaged in a CCE lesson that featured international students and PR students sharing about their own cultures, an Indian dance performance and a friendship craft activity and a modified International Friendship Day Carnival were also organised to engage the Secondary One students. At the various stations, students had the opportunity to take part in a Kahoot Quiz, play a Matching Flag card game, learn ASEAN languages, dance to the beat of India Waale, and play the \`ASEAN Ping-Pong’ game.

#### National Day Programme

In the lead up to the School’s National Day Celebration, students were involved in a discussion on their role in the SGSecure national movement based on a video on national security threats and community response from the Sengkang NPC. Students had also the opportunity to view performances by the school’s Choir and the National Cadet Corps (Air) and competed in a Kahoot! Quiz. Students discussed the lyrics of the latest NDP community song and video clips of the other community songs. Through the Structured Reading Programme articles, students also learnt how our Singapore athletes demonstrated the Singapore Spirit as they trained for the Olympics during the Covid-19 pandemic. Students also showed their appreciation to front-liners for their work during the pandemic, through the National Day Gratitude Card Project organised by Big At Heart and led by the various CCE Student Ambassadors at the class level. More than 500 cards were submitted for this project and they were distributed to the front-liners by the Ministry of Manpower. The school’s logo was even featured in the website of Big At Heart (https://www.bigatheart.org/national-day-gratitude-card-project) as a supporting partner. In support of the Sengkang Central National Day Celebration 2021, a video of the school’s flag raising ceremony for the National Day Celebration video was also submitted and was featured in the Sengkang Community Club’s facebook page.

National Service Singapore Engagement Session  

Educating our students on the importance of National Service is a key component of Character and Citizenship Education (CCE). As such, an engagement session was organised for graduating Secondary 4 and 5 students as part of the National Day programme to help them appreciate the importance of NS and prepare male students for National Service. Our own alumni students Brandon Choo \[2016\] & SGT Nor Hisyam \[2012\] from SAF and SPF respectively had been invited to share their experiences through a recorded zoom session of the Engagement Session facilitated by our National Education Committee teacher. Students from the audience were given the opportunity to engage the speakers in a short \`Question and Answer’ session.

  

#### National Registration Identity Card Presentation Ceremony

The ceremony for all Secondary Three students was conducted in conjunction with the National Day programme this year. It began with an introduction on what it means to be a citizen of Singapore, followed by video clips and sharing sessions on what it means to be \`stateless’ as well as interesting facts about the Singapore NRIC and how to handle it with care. Selected students were then presented with certificates from their respective form teachers to symbolise their attainment of citizenship. Four teacher representatives in a video clip then led the cohort to recite the National Pledge in four different languages. Finally, students were encouraged to reflect on what it means to be Singaporean and their roles and responsibilities as a citizen. This was certainly a milestone citizenship experience for all Secondary 3 students.

#### Chingay Assembly Programme  

As a way to mark 60 years of community building by the People's Association in 2020, this year’s Chingay Assembly programme featured in a fun and engaging manner modern and traditional art forms co-existing peacefully and bonding different generations of people together. Through this programme, all students understood how different generations of practitioners of the traditional and modern art forms could work well together, and the need to embrace such diversity in culture. 

  

#### International Friendship Day

In line with the theme ‘Beyond Borders’, a series of activities were organised to help students understand that while the COVID-19 pandemic has forced many countries to shut their borders to reduce the risk of citizens being infected by the novel coronavirus, countries have also made efforts to collaborate with one another during this difficult period. Through presentation slides, static display, video clip of interview with International Students from China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Japan and India. The slides highlighted their countries’ responses to the global health crisis. Students appreciate the significance of the need for all countries to cooperate to manage the impact of this pandemic.

  

Racial Harmony Day  

Based on the theme ‘Multicultural Singapore’, Racial Harmony Day was commemorated through a series of activities that included viewing a thought-provoking video clip on perspectives about race and religion in Singapore, appreciation of multi-cultural songs played over the PA system, and a static display featuring wedding customs of our major races in the canteen.  Reading of the Straits Times articles promotes positive experiences in our interactions with others by being more sensitive in our interactions with others. 

  

During CCE lessons, students were given the opportunity to discuss prejudices and discrimination and how such negative sentiments could be reduced. Secondary 1 students were given the opportunity to listen to traditional music, participate in dances of different ethnic groups in Singapore while Secondary 2 students were brought through an online game to understand more about the different traditional games of different ethnic groups in Singapore. The Secondary 3 students were engaged in producing henna designs and making Malay wedding gifts while the Secondary 4s and 5s were tasked to design fusion costumes. The winners were pleasantly surprised when they were awarded traditional games which they could bring home to enjoy with their own family members.
