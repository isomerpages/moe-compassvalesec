“National Education aims to develop national cohesion, the instinct for survival and confidence in our future. We must equip them with the basic attitudes, values and instincts which make them Singaporeans. This is the common culture that will give them a shared perception of life, and draw them closer together as one people when confronted with serious problems. This will give them a well-founded faith in the country’s future. ”

*Mr Lee Hsien Loong, Prime Minister<br>
Launch Of National Education<br>
17 May 1997*

As part of the CCE programme, the NE programme acts as a platform for the achievement of the school’s thrust: \`a holistic values-driven learning experience for student-centric meritocracy’. The National Education seeks to provide experiences to support the school in realising its vision ‘World Ready Youths – Innovative contributors, upright citizens with a global outlook’.  The \`Head, Heart and Hands’ approach is deployed in its organisation of Citizenship programmes which will help develop students’ citizenship dispositions through a variety of key Student Development Experiences such as NE Commemorative Days, Cohort Learning Journey and NRIC Presentation Ceremony which will contribute towards the holistic development of all students.
