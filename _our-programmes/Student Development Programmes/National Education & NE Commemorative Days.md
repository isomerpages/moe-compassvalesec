# National Education Programme

 
As part of the CCE programme, the NE programme acts as a platform for the achievement of the school’s thrust of \`a holistic values-driven learning experience for student-centric meritocracy’. Compassvale Secondary School (CVSS) sets itself to mould World Ready Youths – Innovative contributors, upright citizens with a global outlook as the direction for its National Education pursuit. The \`Head, Heart and Hands’ approach is deployed in its organisation of Citizenship programmes which will help develop students’ citizenship dispositions through a variety of Key Student Development Experiences such as NE Commemorative Days, Cohort Learning Journey and NRIC Presentation Ceremony which will contribute towards the holistic development of all students.

The following are various key student learning experiences that help them to extend their learning within and beyond the classroom.
