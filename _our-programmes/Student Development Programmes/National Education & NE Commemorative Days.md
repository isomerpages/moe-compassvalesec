“National Education aims to develop national cohesion, the instinct for survival and confidence in our future. We must equip them with the basic attitudes, values and instincts which make them Singaporeans. This is the common culture that will give them a shared perception of life, and draw them closer together as one people when confronted with serious problems. This will give them a well-founded faith in the country’s future. ”

*Mr Lee Hsien Loong, Prime Minister<br>
Launch Of National Education<br>
17 May 1997*

As part of the CCE programme, the NE programme acts as a platform for the achievement of the school’s thrust: \`a holistic values-driven learning experience for student-centric meritocracy’. The National Education seeks to provide experiences to support the school in realising its vision ‘World Ready Youths – Innovative contributors, upright citizens with a global outlook’.  The \`Head, Heart and Hands’ approach is deployed in its organisation of Citizenship programmes which will help develop students’ citizenship dispositions through a variety of key Student Development Experiences such as NE Commemorative Days, Cohort Learning Journey and NRIC Presentation Ceremony which will contribute towards the holistic development of all students.

### 5 KEY PILLARS of National Education

1.  Every Singaporean Matters
2.  Strong Families: Our Foundation and Our Future
3.  Opportunities for All
4.  The Singapore Heartbeat: Feeling Passionately About Singapore
5.  Active Citizens - Making a Difference to Society  
      
    

### 6 NATIONAL EDUCATION MESSAGES

1.  Singapore is our homeland; this is where we belong. We treasure our heritage and take pride in shaping our own unique way of life.
2.  We must preserve racial and religious harmony. We value our diversity and are determined to stay a united people.  
3.  We must uphold meritocracy and incorruptibility. We provide opportunities for all, according to their ability and effort.  
4.  No one owes Singapore a living. We find our own way to survive and prosper, turning challenge into opportunity.
5.  We must ourselves defend Singapore. We are proud to defend Singapore ourselves, no one else is responsible for our security and well-being.
6.  We have confidence in our future. United, determined and well-prepared, we have what it takes to build a bright future for ourselves, and to progress together as one nation.

### NE Commemmorative Events


  

#### Total Defence Day 

In line with the theme \`Together We Keep Singapore Strong ‘, a series of activities were organised to commemorate Total Defence this year. These included a CCE lesson that started with a TDD 2021 video Message by Minister of Defence, Dr Ng Eng Hen on his Facebook page. Two reading articles - \`Better workplaces with National Service-friendly policies’ and \`Singaporeans to join forces to battle online radicalisation of young people’ - were prepared to engage the Lower Secondary and Upper Secondary students respectively on security issues.  Through a video Board Game designed by the Singapore Discovery Centre, students realised the importance of resilience as they witnessed the challenges faced by the various characters in the stories of hope and optimism during the Covid-19 pandemic. The CCE Department also worked with the various uniformed group CCAs to set up booths featuring the pillars of Total Defence and the Secondary Three students had the opportunity to learn first aid, play team bonding games and quizzes on work of the various defence forces as they visited the various stations.  A static display on the 6 Pillars of Total Defence and how Singapore fell to the Japanese on the first day of Chinese New Year were put up as this year’s TDD took place during the period of Chinese New Year Celebrations.

#### International Students’ Bonding Programme

As part of the school’s efforts to integrate and build mutual understanding between local and international students, the International Students’ Bonding Programme was organised to welcome the Secondary One International Students as well as Permanent Residents who had just joined the school, and to enhance their understanding and appreciation of the diverse cultures of Singapore. This year, on 29 January, these student participants joined the local student buddies to celebrate the inscription of Singapore’s hawker culture on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity through a sharing on Hawker Culture in Singapore, partaking of ethnic food and playing of the virtual Hawker Culture Game. The session ended with the playing of traditional games such as Chapteh, Five stones, Pick up Sticks and Marbles.
