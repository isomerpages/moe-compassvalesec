### Cyber Wellness Programme

Cyber Wellness in CVSS entails a comprehensive programme equipped to provide an understanding of the appropriate and responsible behaviour with regard to the use of technology as well as the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes on how to protect oneself and other internet users in the cyber world. 

The school adopts a three-pronged approach to Cyber Wellness Education:

*   Cyber Wellness Programme for Students -This programme is conducted at three levels:                                     
    
    * All levels of CVSS students are taught lessons in cyber use, identity, relationships and citizenship as well as ethics. These lessons are linked to student development experiences such as co-curricular activities and the Values in Action programme.
    
    * Lower secondary students embark on a Cyber Wellness Quest, where they engage in activities with game elements designed to excite their interest in learning, completing a series of teacher-designed tasks on topics such as positive online etiquette, online dangers, gaming addiction, cyber bullying and online scams.
    
    * Upper secondary students participate in student advocacy for cyber wellness (such as by creating podcasts, videos or digital toolkits to raise awareness about anti-cyberbullying). Students also attend talks about the opportunities and dangers in the cyber world.
    

*   Professional development for Teachers - CVSS teachers attended training to effectively deliver the CCE2021 curriculum. This year, teachers can pick up facilitation skills for upper secondary students on discussion of contemporary issues like cyber wellness. They will also develop blended learning modules on the topic of cyber wellness.
    

*   Partnership with Parents - Parents of CVSS students are encouraged to work in close partnership with the school on cyber wellness education. For example, parents can benefit from resources on cyber wellness. CVSS will also work alongside parents to resolve any issues involving their children.
  
In 2022, the CCE department also hosted Minister of State, Ms Sun Xue Ling, by showcasing the school’s Cyber Wellness programme. Ms Sun had a fruitful dialogue session with the staff and students. She also observed a lesson in which students discussed issues related to cyber wellness.

**Cyber Wellness Quest (Secondary 1 and 2 students)**

All our lower secondary students participated in the Cyber Wellness Quest. The quest is an in-house programme designed by our teachers with game elements to engage and excite students in their learning. Students complete a series of tasks on topics such as positive online etiquette, online dangers, gaming addiction, cyberbullying and online scams. Each level focuses on different themes such as Understanding the Cyberspace for Secondary 1 students and Responding to Cyber issues for Secondary 2 students.

  
**Cyber Smart Programme (Secondary 3 and 4/5 students)**

Our Secondary 3 students participated in the Cyber Smart Programme which focuses on the theme of Advocacy for Cyber Wellness. Students create podcasts, videos and bookmarks on cyberbullying. The videos are then shown to lower secondary students to raise awareness on cyberbullying. Students also create digital toolkits to spread anti-cyberbullying messages to other levels. 

The Secondary 4/5 students participated in the Cyber Smart Programme that focuses on the theme of Harnessing Cyber Technology in the 21st Century. Students attended a talk by our alumni member on online dangers and work opportunities in the Cyber Security industry. 
 

**Cyber Wellness Ambassadors Programme**

In addition, a group of cyber wellness ambassadors take the lead in promoting positive Cyber Wellness practices across the school. They participated in the Prove It! Contest, focusing on educating their peers about guarding against online scams.

The Cyber Wellness ambassadors have also participated in the Singapore Schools Cyber Wellness Challenge since 2023. They mentored a team of primary school participants to create media content illustrating key messages, effectively conveying them to the target audience.
