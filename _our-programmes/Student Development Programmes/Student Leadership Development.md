# Student Leadership Committee

The Student Leadership Committee’s vision “Serve to Lead, Lead to Inspire” guides the committee in developing our North Stars into individuals who can be a source of inspiration to others. Student Leadership development in CVSS is based on the five practices of The Leadership Challenge (TLC). Through these practices, we witnessed our North Stars develop into leaders akin to shining gems – beaming with radiance, as a source of inspiration to all.
