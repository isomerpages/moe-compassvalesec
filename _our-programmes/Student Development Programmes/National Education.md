# National Education Programme
At Compassvale Secondary School, the National Education (NE) programme is a key part of Character and Citizenship Education (CCE). It nurtures in our students a strong sense of belonging, reality, hope, and the will to act — dispositions that shape them into confident, compassionate, and committed citizens.
Through thoughtfully designed commemorative events and experiential learning such as Total Defence Day, National Day, and the NRIC Presentation Ceremony, students explore what it means to be Singaporean and reflect on their roles in safeguarding and shaping our shared future.
Our approach goes beyond commemoration. By engaging students in authentic, student-led experiences that connect Singapore’s past, present, and future, we seek to:
Foster a Sense of Belonging through understanding our shared heritage and values;


Cultivate a Sense of Reality by examining the challenges and trade-offs Singapore faces in an evolving world;


Inspire a Sense of Hope by celebrating the resilience and innovation that drive our nation forward; and


Empower the Will to Act by encouraging students to play an active role in building a cohesive and sustainable Singapore.


Through these sustained efforts, Compassvale Secondary aims to develop World Ready Youths — innovative contributors and upright citizens with a global outlook, grounded in their identity and ready to serve with purpose.

The following are various key student learning experiences that help them to extend their learning within and beyond the classroom:
