# **Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Programme**

In the ECG programme, a whole-school approach is adopted to equip our students with the knowledge, values and skills on education and career matters so that they can make informed decisions as they work towards their aspirations. Through customised student development experiences, students are engaged to discover their interests and passions, gain greater awareness and understanding of tertiary courses and trending industries and develop the necessary skills needed for future world of work. 

In addition, teachers are equipped with ECG facilitation skills and play a pivotal role in helping students connect their academic and co-curricular experiences with their education and career goals. With the support from our ECG counsellor and partnership with various tertiary institutions, our students are provided with opportunities to participate in online ECG events and workshops.
