Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is about equipping our students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make decisions at each key education stage to ensure a successful transition to post-secondary education or work.

  

Our ECG Counsellor is stationed at the school every Wednesdays to provide support to students (individually or in small groups) to help them make informed decisions on post-secondary education and career options.  Students who would like to explore more about subject choices, enquire about post-secondary education options or find out more about their career interests, strengths and passions, can have a chat with our school’s ECG Counsellor.

  
An appointment can be made with the ECG Counsellor [here](https://moeecg.appointeze.com/onlinelink/AdelineTeo).  
  
In addition, the MySkillsFuture.sg is a web-based portal designed to facilitate education and career development among students in Singapore. It is premised on the ECG Development Model and contains features that facilitate identity development while bringing students through the process of career awareness, exploration and planning.
