### Cyber Wellness Programme

Cyber Wellness in CVSS entails a comprehensive programme equipped to provide an understanding of the appropriate and responsible behaviour with regard to the use of technology as well as the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes on how to protect oneself and other internet users in the cyber world. On top of classroom-based Cyber Wellness lessons, the department has designed a Cyber Wellness Programme for each level so that students can attain the knowledge and skills progressively as they move on through each level. These included activities such as the Cyber Wellness Quest, Cyber Wellness Advocacy Projects and Cyber Wellness Talks.&nbsp;

  

### Cyber Wellness Quest (Secondary 1 and 2 students)

All our lower secondary students participated in the Cyber Wellness Quest. The quest is an in-house programme designed by our teachers with game elements to engage and excite students in their learning. Students complete a series of tasks on topics such as positive online etiquette, online dangers, gaming addiction, cyberbullying and online scams. Each level focuses on different themes such as Understanding the Cyberspace for Secondary 1 students and Responding to Cyber issues for Secondary 2 students.

### Cyber Smart Programme (Secondary 3 and 4/5 students)

Our Secondary 3 students participated in the Cyber Smart Programme which focuses on the theme of Advocacy for Cyber Wellness. Students create podcasts, videos and bookmarks on cyberbullying. The videos are then shown to lower secondary students to raise awareness on cyberbullying. Students also create digital toolkits to spread anti-cyberbullying messages to other levels.&nbsp;

  

The Secondary 4/5 students participated in the Cyber Smart Programme that focuses on the theme of Harnessing Cyber Technology in the 21st Century. Students attended a talk by our alumni member on online dangers and work opportunities in the Cyber Security industry.&nbsp;

### Cyber Wellness Ambassadors Programme

In addition, a group of cyber wellness ambassadors participated in the National Challenge Advocacy Competition where participants were tasked to create a toolkit and outreach project to raise awareness of and guard against fake news.&nbsp; Our North Stars, Faun Loo (2N3), Sofia Teo (3E1), Nagarajan Gautham Karthik (3E5) and Tan Kwan Wei (3E5) achieved a Silver award among 70 participating primary and secondary schools.&nbsp;

### Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Department

The Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Department aims to instil in our North Stars core values that will serve as the foundation for their character and provide a compass for their conduct. The department aims to develop the social and emotional competencies of our North Stars so that they are able to manage themselves and their relationships more effectively as well as to make responsible decisions in their lives. In addition, we develop in our students the 21st Century skills so as to prepare them to be ready for the world beyond their secondary school years. We also seek to nurture our studentsâ€™ citizenship skills and attitudes so that they can contribute actively as concerned citizens and remain rooted to Singapore. These goals are realised by engaging our North Stars through the Head, Heart and Hands Approach via our CCE lessons, department and school-wide programmes.

### Cyber Wellness Quest

During this unprecedented period, the Cyber Wellness team curated a Cyber Wellness Quest to deliver responsible use of digital technologies to effect a positive and healthy cyber culture at home and in school. Through cyber wellness training sessions, cyber wellness ambassadors are equipped with relevant knowledge of cyber wellness issues and better prepared to inspire and promote safe and responsible use of information and communications technology to the rest of the school population. The quest aimed to equip students with relevant knowledge of cyber wellness trends such as gaming addiction, scams and cyber bullying in the form of deck toys and instil the importance of positive online presence. This quest served to reinforce the importance of cyber wellness and its messages, instilling sound values and enabling students to make informed decisions. It also comprises cyber wellness lessons incorporated in the CCE curriculum aimed to instil social-emotional competencies and advocating positive use of technology.&nbsp;
