# Values in Action (VIA) Experiences
At our school, we are committed to nurturing responsible and socially aware citizens who are passionate about making a positive impact in their community. Our Values in Action (VIA) experiences provide students with the Head, Heart and Hands approach, where they acquire knowledge and skills through workshops and experiential learning opportunities. With this foundation, students are empowered to initiate projects to serve the school and the community in meaningful ways that create positive and sustainable impacts.

Our vision, ‘Every Student a Champion for Change’, drives our efforts to provide platforms for our students’ voices to be heard, opportunities to explore social innovation and maintain sustained partnerships with our community partners. Through collaborative efforts, our students co-create service projects that address pressing concerns, exercise ownership, and develop ways to serve others. Our goal is to foster a culture of service, empathy and social responsibility that extends beyond our school and into the wider community.

  

**Under the Green Compass Programme, each level focuses on a different aspect of sustainable living:**


*   Sustainable Waste 
    

*   Sustainable Food Sources
    

*   Sustainable Habits    
  

*   Sustainable Gifting
    
Ultimately, the various VIA experiences instill a strong moral compass in our students and nurture them to be World-Ready Youths who are innovative contributors and upright citizens with a global outlook. We envision our North Stars to continue their passion for community service beyond their 4-5 years in CVSS and be active agents of change for the betterment of others.

*Our students got creative at a level-wide workshop on plastic recycling. Using the bottle caps they collected, they designed unique coasters and carabiners — turning waste into meaningful school corporate gifts.*
