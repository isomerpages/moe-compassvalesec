### Student Development Team

The Student Development Team (SDT) aims to promote the holistic development and well-being of all students by providing thoughtfully-curated programmes that are aligned to the school motto of ‘Realising the Star Within’ and the North Star Education Programme (NSEP). With its focus on student-centricity, the SDT designs specific learning experiences to meet the developmental needs of our North Stars at each level, and seeks to provide varied and authentic opportunities for our North Stars to develop their character, social-emotional competencies and emerging 21st Century Competencies.

### 2021

### The STAR Programme

In the last week of Term 1, our North Stars went through our signature STAR 1 programme. Focusing on student development, this programme was based on the STAR theme: Seek out My Strength; Take Responsibility; Adopt an Enterprising Spirit; Ready for the World. Different activities were planned around these themes, although they had to be scaled down as most of the activities had to be confined to interactions within the class, in keeping with the existing Covid-19 Safe Management Measures.  
  

##### Secondary 1

To help our Secondary Ones seek out their strengths, they were put through TetraMap profiling, where they discovered their personal and inter-personal strengths. This experience helped participants identify the element that best describes them and their classmates, enabling them to identify classmates of similar strengths and to learn how to interact with classmates with different personalities. Moreover, the form teachers led the students through a reflection process to gain better self-awareness by reviewing the results of their Social-Emotional Competencies Inventory survey. The Secondary Ones also learnt to take responsibility as leaders through The Leadership Challenge workshop. 

   

##### Secondary 2  

In an endeavour to take responsibility for themselves and their environment, the Secondary 2 students experienced three and a half days of activities to learn more about themselves and their role in the larger world. On the first day of STAR 1, the Secondary 2 students learnt crucial environment saving skills from a series of Upcycling workshops. On top of taking responsibility for the environment, the students also ventured into outdoor spaces and learnt to adopt an enterprising attitude towards new challenges. As they participated in the Outdoors Non-Residential Adventure activities in Sembawang Park and all over the Northern region of Singapore, the Secondary Twos challenged themselves to accomplish tasks and solve problems in both land and water activities. They learnt a variety of skills: camp craft, orienteering, and raft-building. Our students also stepped out of their comfort zones participating in newly included activities such as kayaking and stand up paddling, and cycling. Our Secondary Twos displayed a strong enterprising spirit as they overcame their personal limits and developed confidence.   

  

#####  Secondary 3

For our Secondary Threes, the STAR 1 Programme aimed to provide authentic opportunities for students to adopt an enterprising spirit and resilience in overcoming challenges and willingness to try out new things in new environments. It also enabled the Secondary 3s to rediscover themselves and their interests and strengths through a variety of courses offered. In this four-day programme, the Secondary 3 Normal (Technical) students attended their Elective Module (EM) conducted by ITE College either at ITE College Central itself or in school, whereas the Secondary 3 Normal (Academic) students attended STEM-related EMs conducted by vendors in schools. While the majority of Secondary 3 Express students attended Advanced Elective Modules (AEM) at various polytechnics, a small group attended STEM-related enrichment programme. Through these four  days, the students got a taste of tertiary education as they took on hands-on experiments, project planning and presentations, after which the students were assessed on their knowledge of the module. Although it was a steep learning curve for our students, it was an enriching learning experience.  

  

##### Secondary 4 and 5

Our Secondary 4 and 5 North Stars participated in a three-day Ready For The World Programme aimed at equipping them with knowledge, life-skills and attitude to be ready for the world after graduation. The theme on the first day was ‘Discovering Who I Am’, in which our North Stars took part in experiential learning activities and completed the DISC profiling tool to seek out their strengths and learning styles, develop their personal brands, learn interview skills and plan their portfolio to prepare for life after secondary school. ‘Exploring My Education and Career Pathways’ was the theme for the second day on which speakers and alumni from various post-secondary institutions and industries shared with our North Stars about post-secondary course and career options. In addition, our North Stars learnt financial literacy. Furthermore, Secondary 4 students learnt how to make responsible, informed decisions through HPB Sexuality Education eTeens programme. Last but not least, Secondary 5NA students participated in a Pathfinder workshop to chart their education journey and learn ways to open up more possibilities and options. 

All in all, our North Stars had many memorable and enriching experiential learning experiences during the entire STAR 1 programme, where many made personal discoveries and stepped out of their comfort zones to embrace new challenges. It was a good break from the usual routines of daily lessons - some made personal discoveries, some bonded with their teachers and peers. Over and above, these experiences will take them one step closer towards finding their compass in life!  

  

##### GEAR-UP Programme & After-School Centre  

The GEAR-UP Operational Team successfully embarked on the Guiding and Empowering Students for Affiliation and Resilience to Unlock their Potential (GEAR-UP) Programme to support high needs students. It aims to help these students enhance learning motivation, strengthen school connectedness and build resilience through opportunities to grow and contribute back to school via service learning and the GEAR-UP Changemakers leadership programme, as well as other leadership opportunities. 

In addition to the regular after-school activities planned for students in our GEAR-UP Programme such as futsal, eSports, yoga and woodworking, the successful implementation and use of the After-School Centre (ASC) have provided a safe, supportive, positive and caring haven for our students. The students also developed positive relationships through the presence of significant adults and positive peer groups.


### North Star's Pledge


The North Star’s Pledge was first implemented in 2017, with a mission to instil a greater sense of ownership and cultivate a strong positive mindset amongst our North Stars. After a year of implementation, recitation and review, 2018 saw a revised version of the pledge that now captures the heart of our school ethos, which is what we hope our North Stars possess. This year, the upper secondary classes took turns to create videos to share their reflections and application of the pledge in their lives. In reciting the pledge every Monday during morning assembly, our North Stars are reminded of the best that they can be – to have a positive disposition towards learning and finding their purpose; to have a mindset of excellence to pursue their personal best; to have the courage to grow and lead meaningful and purposeful lives; and to have the desire to shine and lead the way for others like the immovable, guiding light of a North Star.

### The STAR Programme 


In the last week of Term 1, our North Stars went through our signature STAR 1 programme. Focusing on student development, this programme was based on the STAR theme: Seek out My Strength; Take Responsibility; Adopt an Enterprising Spirit; Ready for the World. Different activities were planned around these themes, although they had to be scaled down as most of the activities had to be confined to interactions within the class, in keeping with to the existing Covid-19 Safe Management Measures.

#### Seek Out My Strength  

The Secondary One students went through the TetraMap profiling, where they discovered their personal and interpersonal strengths. This helped them identify the element that best describes them and their classmates, enabling them to identify classmates of similar strengths and learn how to interact with classmates with different personalities. For the Secondary Two students, they were led through a process of reflecting on the results of the Social-Emotional Competency Inventory (SECi) quiz which they took earlier. This allowed them to think of ways to leverage their strengths and work on developing their Areas for Growth, as they continue their journey as a North Star. Similarly, the Secondary Fours and Fives went through a personal effectiveness and personal branding workshop as part of their Ready for the World Programme, where they gained awareness of their strengths, weaknesses and interests, and also developed their personal brand to make themselves marketable in future.

#### Take Responsibility

To learn to take responsibility as a leader, the Secondary One students went through ‘The Leadership Challenge’ workshop, where they learnt how to model the way, inspire a shared vision, and challenge the process through games and activities. For example, students exercised their communication skills and learnt the importance of teamwork in order to achieve a shared objective.  For the Sec Twos, they were equipped with the Social Skill of speaking up with confidence, so that they will develop responsibility for their actions under different situations. The Sec Threes attended a Service Learning workshop, which equipped them with the relevant competencies and know-how to identify needs, plan and execute successfully a meaningful Service Learning Project with our VIA partners, enabling them to take on the responsibility of doing their part for the community to be socially responsible citizens.

#### Adopt an Enterprising Spirit

Instead of an overnight outdoor adventure camp, the Secondary Two cohort participated in a series of campcraft activities, including tent-pitching and structure building, which allowed the students to develop team work and problem-solving skills. Unfortunately, the other outdoor activities and camps for other levels could not be carried out, due to Covid-19 preventive measures.  

#### Ready for the World

The Secondary Fours and Fives attended our Ready for the World Programme aimed at equipping them with knowledge, life-skills and attitude such as personal branding and interview skills to be ready for the world after graduation. ‘Exploring My Education and Career Pathways’ was another focus programme where speakers from various post-secondary institutions and industries shared about post-secondary courses and career options. 

The Case Management Team also successfully embarked on the Guiding and Empowering Students for Affiliation and Resilience to Unlock their Potential (GEAR-UP) Programme to support at-risk students. It aims to help students enhance learning motivation, strengthen school connectedness, form positive relationships, build resilience, increase self-worth through opportunities to grow and contribute through service learning.

In addition to the regular after-school activities planned for students in our GEAR-UP Programme such as futsal, yoga and culinary appreciation, the successful implementation and use of the After-School Centre (ASC) has provided a safe and caring haven for our students.

This unusual year with many unprecedented challenges, brought about a STAR1 programme that was not as varied and exciting as the previous years. Nonetheless, our North Stars certainly had their little dose of fun with some interesting and enriching episodes. It was a good break from the usual routines of daily lessons, where some made personal discoveries, some bonded with their teachers and peers, while others developed the grit to be ready for future challenges. The learning gained remained just as valuable in helping them grow to become shining North Stars in different ways.

### Social Skills Training


*‘Social skills are sets of behaviours that enable individuals to interact with one another in ways that are socially acceptable as well as personally and mutually beneficial, or beneficial to others.’*

*Elliot & Gresham, 1993; Hensley, Powell, Lamke, Hartman & Graveve, 2007*

In alignment with the school Culture and Ethos, the SDT embarked on Social Skills Training to equip our students with essential skills that would help enhance their social skills as young adults. All Form Teachers were trained to teach Social Skills and our North Stars were explicitly taught the skills that were specifically identified by the teachers of each level to help them develop pro-social and effective learning behaviours on top of our school-based CCE curriculum. The Secondary One students were taught the skills of _Making Positive Self-Statements, Asking for Help, Disagreeing Appropriately and Giving Complients_ during the STAR Programme while the Secondary Two, Three, 

Four and Five students were taught the skills of _Making An Apology, Organising Tasks _and Time, and Reflecting and Improving_ respectively during CCE lessons and Form Teacher Time (FT Time). The students and teachers have given feedback that they found the skills learnt useful and looked forward to learning more social skills in time to come._
