The Pastoral Care Committee (PS) strives to create and sustain a caring school culture where all members of the school community feel safe and cared for, have a sense of belonging to the school, and feel connected to one another. Such a culture is built upon a solid foundation of quality relationships based on trust, good character, values, and a warm and supportive school environment. Students experience a caring school culture primarily through positive teacher-student relationship (TSR) and peer support and relationship (PSR).

To foster good PSR in the school, the Pastoral Care Committee oversees the selection of suitable students to be peer support leaders (PSLs) and works closely with them throughout the year. Every year, Form Teachers will select two suitable PSLs from each class. PSLs are elected based on qualities of confidence, care and compassion, and the ability to build rapport with people. The Pastoral Care Committee also selects suitable students to be peer support student mentors (PSSMs) to guide and support PSLs in their roles by sharing their experiences and advice. PSSMs are selected from the pool of PSLs from the previous year.

The Pastoral Care Committee helms the PSL and PSSMs training programmes to equip our PSLs and PSSMs with the necessary skills and tools that will help them journey through school life with their peers in school. The selected PSLs will attend PSL training sessions conducted by trained teachers, where they will learn to recognise signs of DISTRESS, Peer Helping Skills (CHEER Model), Basic Attending Skills (SOLER/CROPS Model), Active Listening Skills, and Facilitation Skills. PSLs are trained to be sensitive to behavioural changes and mood swings of their peers and regularly consult their Form Teachers on the well-being of the class. During these training sessions, PSLs will also be involved in activities that require them to communicate with each other creatively through games and role-play as well as prepare care packs for peers in need.

  

With the prevailing safe management measures (SMM) in place, our annual PSL Appreciation Day was conducted online in Semester 2. PSLs were given tokens of appreciation ahead of the online sessions, which were helmed by the Pastoral Care Committee. The peer support teacher mentors (PSTMs) engaged the students in online discussions and activities via Zoom and other platforms. The PSLs and PSTMs had a meaningful time reflecting on their experience as PSLs through this engagement.

During this volatile period, ensuring students’ overall well-being proved significantly more important than ever before. Apart from training the PSLs to support their peers, the Pastoral Care Committee supported the teachers in supporting students’ overall well-being by providing mental wellness packages and conducting talks.  

The Pastoral Care Committee aspires to build an inclusive and supportive school environment that extends to the wider community as the students journey through life.

At the end of Semester 2 this year, the PSLs led and facilitated the activities conducted during Breakfast with FTs on the final day of the academic year. These activities served to promote class bonding and interaction. Through this programme, the PSLs befriend socially less adaptable students and make them feel welcomed and included.

In this unprecedented year, building positive TSR and strong PSR proved significantly more important than ever before. Apart from training the PSLs to support their peers, the Pastoral Care Committee supported the teachers in building positive TSR by planning bonding activities that Form Teachers could conduct at the start of Term 3 to help them rebuild class spirit after two months of Circuit Breaker.
