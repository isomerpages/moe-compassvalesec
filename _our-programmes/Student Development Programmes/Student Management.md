In order to build a positive and safe school environment, the Student Management Department in CVSS facilitates an educative approach which requires school personnel to adopt a supportive and caring attitude towards our students. This approach empowers students to be actively involved in their character development.  

CVSS uses ‘Restorative Practice’ as our main approach in helping our students understand that their actions carry consequences, and therefore, they must learn to take responsibility for their own actions and make amends to repair the relationship(s) that is/are harmed. We believe that disciplinary measures, while serving as consequences for the inappropriate choices made by our students, must be meted out fairly, firmly, and appropriately.  

A whole-school approach is used in promoting positive student behaviour, instilling self-discipline in students and managing student disciplinary issues according to the school’s values and ethos, as well as working closely with our school police liaison officers in order to educate our students on wider discipline issues. With each Student Management Department member being insistent, consistent and persistent, we seek to imbue in our North Stars values that will enable them to be world ready youths.
