The Physical Education (PE) and Sports Nutrition curriculum is aimed at enabling our students to demonstrate the physical skills, practices and values to enjoy a lifetime of active and healthy living individually or with others. It is also designed to develop in our students the ability to demonstrate this knowledge and disposition across a variety of sports, such as through the inter-class games across different levels.

The curriculum also incorporates aspects of sports science, including nutrition, injuries prevention and management  to equip our students with the knowledge to develop self-directedness in pursuit of life-long healthy living.
