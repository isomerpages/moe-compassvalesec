As part of our vision to develop World Ready Youth, we place a strong emphasis on Leadership and Service in Compassvale Secondary School. Our students grow and serve through a wide range of development opportunities in service and leadership, carefully curated and structured to provide authentic, experiential, and age appropriate learning as they progress from lower to upper secondary. We empower our students with service leadership practices, instill in them a commitment to serving others, and encourage them to be a positive influence in their communities.Â 

We believe that developing our students in leadership and service equips them with a strong foundation to excel academically and develop into responsible, compassionate, and community-minded individuals who actively contribute to positive change in their everyday lives. Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) - Green Compass Programme, and our Student Leadership Programme support our efforts to nurture upright, compassionate leaders who serve and contribute to the community.
