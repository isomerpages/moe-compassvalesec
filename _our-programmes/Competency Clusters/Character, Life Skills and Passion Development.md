At Compassvale Secondary School, Character, Life Skills and Passion Development seeks to instil in our North Stars strong core values that serve as the foundation of their character and the compass for their conduct. <br>
Our programmes are designed to develop our students’ social and emotional competencies, digital media literacy and 21st Century Competencies (including Emerging 21st Century Competencies), enabling them to manage themselves effectively and build positive relationships with others. <br>
Believing that every North Star has the innate potential to shine, we provide authentic and diverse opportunities for students to uncover and nurture their values, interests, passions, skills and strengths. Through these experiences, they grow in confidence and purpose, equipping them to thrive and make a positive impact in the world beyond their secondary school years.
