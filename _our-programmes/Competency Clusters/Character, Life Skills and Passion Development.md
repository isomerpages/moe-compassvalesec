Character, Life Skills and Passion Development at CVSS seeks to instil in our North Stars core values that will serve as the foundation for their character and provide a compass for their conduct. Programmes aim to grow the social and emotional competencies, digital media literacy and 21st century competencies of our North Stars to be able to manage themselves and their relationships more effectively. Believing that our students have the innate potential to shine, the school provides ample opportunities to help students uncover and nurture their personal values, interests, passions, skills and strengths to work towards their aspirations. This will prepare them to be ready for the world beyond their secondary school years.
