Singapore's aerospace industry has been growing at an average of 8.6% annually over the last 20 years, and we now have a 10% share of the global aerospace maintenance, repair and overhaul market. CVSS’s Aeronautics ALP in the domain of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) thus, provides a distinctive and valuable proposition to our stakeholders in the Sengkang/Punggol community especially with the fast-growing Seletar Aerospace Park being right in the vicinity.  
  
Through the ALP, students sharpen their competencies in critical and inventive thinking, and hone their problem-solving skills through linking what they have learnt in the core subjects of Physics, Design and Technology and Mathematics to hands-on learning in aeronautics.  
  

#### STEM-in-Aeronautics Modules

All Secondary One students went through a basic 20-hour module within curriculum time in semester two. Through theory lessons and practical activities, students learned about the science behind flight. The lessons culminated in students working in groups to build a foam glider, and testing the flight-worthiness of their artefacts. All Secondary Two students then went through another intermediate 20-hour module in semester one. Students learned about recent developments in flight technology, including the principles behind drone technology and how drones have been used in real-life applications. The lessons culminated in students working in groups to programme a drone that can autonomously complete an obstacle course. Our students received the Singapore Polytechnic Young Engineers Award (Applied Learning) on completion of both the basic and intermediate modules. At the end of each semester, students will usually demonstrate their learning and showcase their work to each other at the ALP Learning Festival. However, this was not possible in light of the Covid-19 situation.  
  

Students have had various opportunities to link the theories they learned in Science and Physics to real world applications in the aerospace industry. One way this was done was through various aeronautics enrichment workshops arranged for our students. One example of this was the Top Gun Aviator workshop, in which students were taught how to fly an airplane using flight simulator software.

  

#### Aeronautics Co-Curricular Programme

Talented students were selected to take part in aeronautics competitions such as the ‘Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition’ co-organised by DSO National Laboratories and the Singapore Science Centre. Our North Stars rose up to the challenge despite restrictions put in place due to COVID-19 and swept a myriad of awards in the unpowered gliders, radio-controlled planes, first-person view racing and semi-autonomous flight categories.

To complement what they have learnt through the STEM-in-Aeronautics modules, our Lower Secondary students also participate in level-wide enrichment programmes. This year, our Secondary One students had the opportunity to exercise their creativity and develop their design-thinking skills in a Makers’ Day workshop, in which they were required to design, build and decorate a glider on their own using Balsa wood. Students then tested out the flight-worthiness of their gliders.
