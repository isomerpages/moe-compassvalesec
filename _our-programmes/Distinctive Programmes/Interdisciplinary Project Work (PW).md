##      Interdisciplinary Project Work

To develop the 21st century competencies of critical and inventive thinking, and collaborative problem solving, the CVSS interdisciplinary Project Work curriculum for all Express and N(A) lower secondary students is anchored on the theme of **Sustainable Living**, with the focus on **waste management** in Sec 1 and **energy sustainability** in Sec 2. The interdisciplinary Project Work supports CVSS’s Environment Education efforts to educate our students on the many environmental challenges in the world and the impact of their actions or non-actions on environment sustainability, so as to develop students to be concerned citizens of the world.

To better understand the waste problems in their community and advocate the importance of waste management, Sec 1 students attend talks by the National Environmental Agency (NEA) and go on learning journeys to understand the environmental problems in an authentic way. Students identify waste management problems at home/school/community, derive solutions and create prototypes to solve the issues, making it a student-led initiative facilitated and guided by PW teachers during PW lessons.

Sec 2 students work on the topic of energy sustainability and build prototypes to reduce energy usage by non-renewable sources or harnessing renewable sources of energy to power a household device. PW teachers design STEM lesson package using the design thinking approach to teach students the importance of energy as a precious resource through perspective-taking and creative problem solving.

Going forward, we would be further integrating the interdisciplinary PW into the school’s Applied Learning Programme and Values in Action (VIA) lessons, for environmental awareness to pervade the school’s curriculum.
