Our school’s LLP entitled, **‘Inspired North Stars Inspire Actions’** is a dynamic programme that seeks to empower our students in community and youth leadership and inspire them to make positive impacts through active community service and environmental sustainability outreach. Our programme is designed to provide authentic and experiential learning opportunities that will help our students develop strong character and values, as well as hone 21st-century competencies and social-emotional competencies. Additionally, students will develop specific skills for effective leadership through the Student Leadership Development Programme and engage in various Values-in-Action Experiences. With a focus on developing well-rounded individuals committed to making a difference in their world, our LLP is an excellent choice for students who want to grow personally and make a meaningful impact in their community.
