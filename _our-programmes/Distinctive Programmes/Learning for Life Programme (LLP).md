### Inspired North Stars Inspire Actions

LLP aims to develop our students in community & youth leadership and inspire them into action to create positive impact in the community through active community service and environmental outreach. 

Through authentic and experiential community and service-learning projects, students will develop their character and values, hone 21st Century Competencies, including social-emotional competencies, and develop specific skills for effective leadership.

### Student Leadership Development Programme

As our student leaders live out the vision of ‘Serve to Lead, Lead to Inspire’, every student will develop a strong moral compass and learn to become an exemplary leader to self and others.

Our students will learn and apply the 5 practices of exemplary leadership of The Leadership Challenge (TLC) Model (developed by Jim Kouzes and Barry Pozner)

*   Model the Way
*   Inspire a Shared Vision
*   Challenge the Process
*   Enable Others to Act 
*   Encourage the Heart

Our students will develop and discover their leadership potential through various leadership opportunities in school (Class Committee, CCA Executive Committee and Student Council Board).

Through serving others, such as their friends, families and the community, our student leaders will find their purpose and meaning in life and make a difference in the lives of others.

### Values in Action (VIA) Experiences

The VIA experiences develop our students to be responsible citizens who are concerned about social and environmental issues and are compelled to contribute meaningfully to the community.

Through the Head, Heart and Hands approach, students acquire knowledge and skills through workshops and experiential learning opportunities (Learn to Care) to initiate projects to serve the school and the community to create positive impacts (Care to Serve) with the aim to groom them as youth leaders of the community who create a sustainable impact.

With a focus on providing platforms for Youth Voice, opportunities for Social Innovation and maintaining Sustained Partnerships within the community, students co-create service projects to address concerns, exercise ownership and initiate ways to serve the community and nation.

Students who demonstrate aptitude and interest in community service, are developed and nurtured through other opportunities including:

▪ Community Youth Leaders Club

▪ Project Fire Starters (Ground-Up Initiatives)

▪ Mentoring sessions & learning journeys with VIA Champions

▪ Overseas Service-Learning Programme

  

Ultimately, the VIA experiences instil a strong moral compass in our students and nurture them to be World-Ready Youths who are innovative contributors and upright citizens with a global outlook.

     style="width:60%">
Through the “Head, Heart & Hands” approach, “CVSS CAReS” strives to develop students’ knowledge and competencies in Service Learning through workshops and experiential learning opportunities (Learn to Care), so that they will subsequently become active youth leaders of the community, initiating projects to serve, have a positive impact on the community and inspiring others to act (Care to Serve).

All our students embark on various level wide VIA programmes every year to serve the community.  These include environmental projects under the Green Compass Programme for all Sec 1 and 2 students, adoption of Bright Hill Evergreen Home, Sunlove Home and Bethesda Care Services (Senior Activity Centre) with student-initiated/led service learning projects\* for all Sec 3, 4 & 5 students, annual Overseas Service Learning Programme (OSLP) to neighbouring countries such as Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam for Student Councillors and Community Youth Leaders Club members etc.  The school also partners closely with Sengkang Community Centre, Sengkang General Hospital and North East Community Development Council (NECDC) in community events/projects.     
  
The Community Youth Leaders Club is a tier 2 initiative of our school’s Learning for Life (LLP) Programme in Community & Youth Leadership.  It aims to develop community youth leaders to become self-initiated advocates for the community and exemplary leaders and mentors to other students.  They will work with our various community partners, advocate the needs of the community, identify viable platforms and serve the community through community service projects, including presenting such opportunities to other CCA groups. They will also be our national ambassadors, participate in nation-wide projects/events to make a positive impact to the nation and help strengthen the Singapore Spirit.    
  
 * Service Learning is an approach where students identify the needs of the community, serve the community to meet the needs and reflect upon their experience in working with the community so as to have a good understanding and appreciation of what it involves.
