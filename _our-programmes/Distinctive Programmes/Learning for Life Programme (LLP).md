### Inspired North Stars Inspire Actions

LLP aims to develop our students in community & youth leadership and inspire them into action to create positive impact in the community through active community service and environmental outreach. 

Through authentic and experiential community and service-learning projects, students will develop their character and values, hone 21st Century Competencies, including social-emotional competencies, and develop specific skills for effective leadership.

### Student Leadership Development Programme

As our student leaders live out the vision of ‘Serve to Lead, Lead to Inspire’, every student will develop a strong moral compass and learn to become an exemplary leader to self and others.

Our students will learn and apply the 5 practices of exemplary leadership of The Leadership Challenge (TLC) Model (developed by Jim Kouzes and Barry Pozner)

*   Model the Way
*   Inspire a Shared Vision
*   Challenge the Process
*   Enable Others to Act 
*   Encourage the Heart

Our students will develop and discover their leadership potential through various leadership opportunities in school (Class Committee, CCA Executive Committee and Student Council Board).

Through serving others, such as their friends, families and the community, our student leaders will find their purpose and meaning in life and make a difference in the lives of others.

### Values in Action (VIA) Experiences

The VIA experiences develop our students to be responsible citizens who are concerned about social and environmental issues and are compelled to contribute meaningfully to the community.

Through the Head, Heart and Hands approach, students acquire knowledge and skills through workshops and experiential learning opportunities (Learn to Care) to initiate projects to serve the school and the community to create positive impacts (Care to Serve) with the aim to groom them as youth leaders of the community who create a sustainable impact.

With a focus on providing platforms for Youth Voice, opportunities for Social Innovation and maintaining Sustained Partnerships within the community, students co-create service projects to address concerns, exercise ownership and initiate ways to serve the community and nation.

***Tier 2 Programme***

Students who demonstrate aptitude and interest in community service, are developed and nurtured through other opportunities including:

▪ Community Youth Leaders Club

▪ Project Fire Starters (Ground-Up Initiatives)

▪ Mentoring sessions & learning journeys with VIA Champions

▪ Overseas Service-Learning Programme

  

Ultimately, the VIA experiences instil a strong moral compass in our students and nurture them to be World-Ready Youths who are innovative contributors and upright citizens with a global outlook.
