<h1>Digital and Media Literacy Curriculum (DML)</h1>
<p>The Digital and Media Literacy curriculum equips all Secondary 1 and 2
students with digital literacy and technological skills. This is to ensure
that students are well-equipped with the digital competencies to thrive
in an increasingly technology-saturated future.</p>
<p>Students will learn the fundamentals of productivity and production skills
through the Coursera style lessons and performance tasks designed by the
school. The lessons are self directed and students can learn at their own
pace.</p>
<p>The curriculum aims to help them build competencies to Apply (use digital
tools) and Create (produce digital products and collaborate online).</p>
