# Digital and Media Literacy Curriculum (DML)

The Digital and Media Literacy curriculum equips all Secondary 1 and 2 students with digital literacy and technological skills. This is to ensure that students are well-equipped with the digital competencies to thrive in an increasingly technology-saturated future.

Students will learn the fundamentals of productivity and production skills through the Coursera style lessons and performance tasks designed by the school. The lessons are self directed and students can learn at their own pace. 

The curriculum aims to help them build competencies to Apply (use digital tools) and Create (produce digital products and collaborate online).
