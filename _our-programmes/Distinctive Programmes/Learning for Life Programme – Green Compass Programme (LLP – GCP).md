## Values in Action Experiences&nbsp;

We are unwavering in our commitment to fostering responsible and socially conscious citizens who are deeply passionate about effecting positive change within their community.

Our Values in Action (VIA) experiences equips our students with a solid foundation that empowers them to initiate projects aimed at enhancing the well-being of both our school and the community. These projects are designed not only to create a positive impact but also to ensure that impact is sustainable.

### Key Programmes: 
* Green Compass Programme  
* Environmental Science Leaders Club  
 
Our overarching vision, ‘Every Student a Champion for Change’, is the driving force behind our efforts. It provides a platform for our students' voices to be heard, encourages exploration of social innovation, and nurtures enduring partnerships with our community collaborators. This collaboration leads to the co-creation of service projects that directly address pressing concerns, fostering a sense of ownership and an enduring dedication to serving others. 


The array of VIA experiences instils a strong moral compass in our students, preparing them to become World-Ready Youths who learn, grow and lead. Our aspiration is for our North Stars to carry their passion for community service far beyond their 4 - 5 years at CVSS and become active agents of change, continuously striving for the betterment of others.
