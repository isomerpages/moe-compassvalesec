## Learning for Life Programme (LLP)&nbsp;

Our school's LLP has been reimagined and rebranded as the ‘Green Compass Programme (GCP)’. We are firm in our conviction that education should extend far beyond the classroom, shaping not only scholars of academic excellence but also fostering responsible, compassionate, and community-minded individuals.&nbsp;

The Green Compass Programme is thoughtfully crafted to ignite the spark of community and youth leadership in our students, motivating them to undertake meaningful actions that catalyse positive change in their everyday lives. This programme serves as the guiding light, illuminating the path to responsible citizenship, environmental stewardship, and deep personal growth.

### Theme&nbsp;

Promoting Sustainable Living in the Community&nbsp;&nbsp;

 ### Mission&nbsp;

Inspired North Stars, Inspire Actions - To inspire and encourage fellow North Stars to serve the wider community&nbsp;
