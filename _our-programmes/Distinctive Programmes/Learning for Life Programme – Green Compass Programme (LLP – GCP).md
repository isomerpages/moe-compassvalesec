## Learning for Life Programme (LLP)&nbsp;

Our school's LLP has been reimagined and rebranded as the ‘Green Compass Programme (GCP)’. We are firm in our conviction that education should extend far beyond the classroom, shaping not only scholars of academic excellence but also fostering responsible, compassionate, and community-minded individuals.&nbsp;

The Green Compass Programme is thoughtfully crafted to ignite the spark of community and youth leadership in our students, motivating them to undertake meaningful actions that catalyse positive change in their everyday lives. This programme serves as the guiding light, illuminating the path to responsible citizenship, environmental stewardship, and deep personal growth.

## Values in Action Experiences&nbsp;

We are unwavering in our commitment to fostering responsible and socially conscious citizens who are deeply passionate about effecting positive change within their community.&nbsp;

Our Values in Action (VIA) experiences equips our students with a solid foundation that empowers them to initiate projects aimed at enhancing the well-being of both our school and the community. These projects are designed not only to create a positive impact but also to ensure that impact is sustainable.

### Key Programmes: 
* Green Compass Programme  
* Community Youth Leaders Club (established in 2019) 
 
Our overarching vision, ‘Every Student a Champion for Change’, is the driving force behind our efforts. It provides a platform for our students' voices to be heard, encourages exploration of social innovation, and nurtures enduring partnerships with our community collaborators. This collaboration leads to the co-creation of service projects that directly address pressing concerns, fostering a sense of ownership and an enduring dedication to serving others. 


The array of VIA experiences instils a strong moral compass in our students, preparing them to become World-Ready Youths who learn, grow and lead. Our aspiration is for our North Stars to carry their passion for community service far beyond their 4 - 5 years at CVSS and become active agents of change, continuously striving for the betterment of others.
