<p>The <strong>Perspectives (视界与世界 / Jauh Perjalanan, Luas Pengalaman) </strong>programme
at CVSS offers an innovative overseas learning curriculum designed to expand
students' world-view and deepen their understanding of global issues. Through
a blend of exposures and experiences in Singapore and abroad, Perspectives
opens their eyes to different cultures, cutting-edge technological developments
and global opportunities.</p>
<p><u>Our Learning Approach</u>

<p>At the heart of Perspectives is a neuroscience-informed introspective-comparative
pedagogy. This approach encourages students to reflect on their experiences
and continually assess the synergies and contrasts between Singapore and
the overseas country. By participating in pre-trip learning modules such
as flipped classroom experiences, on-site visits, and daily reflections,
students learn about the interconnectedness of global issues, cultures,
societies and economies. Perspectives culminates in a capstone presentation,
where students synthesise their learning and reflect on the diverse perspectives
they have gained. These experiences hone important 21st century competencies
such as problem-solving, cultural awareness, and communication skills.</p>
