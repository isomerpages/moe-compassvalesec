Believing that every student has the innate potential to shine, the STAR programme provides varied and authentic experiences for our North Stars to uncover and nurture their personal strengths and passions. 

The STAR Programme is designed to grow their sphere of influence, with the following objectives: 

**Sec 1:** Start Right to be Ready For Discovery – North Stars will learn to understand themselves better by identifying their personal strengths, interests and areas for growth. They will also recognise that everyone is unique.

**Sec 2:** Choose Wisely as they grow to be Ready For Responsibility – North Stars will learn to make informed and responsible decisions, and build positive and collaborative relationships.

**Sec 3:** Step Up to be Ready For the Community – North Stars will recognise their roles in the local community by gaining awareness of the needs and finding ways to address them. They will also deepen their understanding of post-secondary progression and job roles and skills needed in the evolving industries.

**Sec 4/5:** Emerge Stronger to be Ready For the World – North Stars will learn how they can make a positive difference to others by preparing themselves for post-secondary education and by gaining awareness of the developments in Singapore and beyond.
