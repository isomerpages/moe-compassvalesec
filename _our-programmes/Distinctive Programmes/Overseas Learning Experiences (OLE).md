<h2>Perspectives: Overseas Learning Experiences (OLE) at CVSS</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The <strong>Perspectives (视界与世界 / Jauh Perjalanan, Luas Pengalaman) </strong>programme
at CVSS offers an innovative overseas learning curriculum designed to expand
students' world-view and deepen their understanding of global issues. Through
a blend of exposures and experiences in Singapore and abroad, Perspectives
opens their eyes to different cultures, cutting-edge technological developments
and global opportunities.</p>

</div>
<p>At the heart of Perspectives is a neuroscience-informed introspective-comparative
pedagogy. This approach encourages students to reflect on their experiences
and continually assess the synergies and contrasts between Singapore and
the overseas country. By participating in pre-trip learning modules such
as flipped classroom experiences, on-site visits, and daily reflections,
students learn about the interconnectedness of global issues, cultures,
societies and economies. Perspectives culminates in a capstone presentation,
where students synthesise their learning and reflect on the diverse perspectives
they have gained. These experiences hone important 21st century competencies
such as problem-solving, cultural awareness, and communication skills.</p>

<p><em><sub>For one of the Vietnam OLE pre-trip learning module, our North Stars studied the vital role of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam’s agriculture and economy, while learning about the environmental challenges it faces. Students were tasked to visit local supermarkets to identify food products originating from Vietnam, sparking curiosity about the country’s agricultural exports. They then took on the perspectives of farmers, businessmen, environmentalists, policymakers, and youth, in a simulated town hall meeting where they voiced challenges, shared aspirations, and sought common ground for sustainable solutions. To round off the session, staff and students enjoyed a spread of authentic Vietnamese food, including Banh Mi and spring rolls.
