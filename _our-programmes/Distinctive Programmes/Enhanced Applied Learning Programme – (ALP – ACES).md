CVSS’s Aeronautics ALP in the domain of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) provides a distinctive, valuable proposition to our stakeholders in the Sengkang/Punggol community especially with the fast-growing Seletar Aerospace Park being right in the vicinity. Through the ALP, students sharpen their competencies in critical and inventive thinking, and hone their problem-solving skills through linking what they have learnt in the core subjects of Physics, Design and Technology and Mathematics to hands-on learning in aeronautics.

**Key Programmes**

*   Hands-on and collaborative learning on the principles of flight through the STEM-in-Aeronautics Programme
    
*   Development of students’ critical and inventive thinking through the ALP Makers’ Day
    
*   Exposure to authentic learning experiences through learning journeys
    
*   Talent development through competitions and workshops
    
*   Internship opportunities within the Aerospace industry to allow students to further explore their interests and aptitudes
