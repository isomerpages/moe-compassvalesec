# Enhanced Applied Learning Programme – Aeronautics, Coding, Engineering, Sustainability (ALP-ACES)


![](/images/2023%20Distinctive%20Programmes/ALP/alp%20committee%20.jpg)

CVSS’s Aeronautics ALP in the domain of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) provides a distinctive, valuable proposition to our stakeholders in the Sengkang/Punggol community especially with the fast-growing Seletar Aerospace Park being right in the vicinity. Through the ALP, students sharpen their competencies in critical and inventive thinking, and hone their problem-solving skills through linking what they have learnt in the core subjects of Physics, Design and Technology and Mathematics to hands-on learning in aeronautics.

**Key Programmes**

*   Hands-on and collaborative learning on the principles of flight through the STEM-in-Aeronautics Programme
    
*   Development of students’ critical and inventive thinking through the ALP Makers’ Day
    
*   Exposure to authentic learning experiences through learning journeys
    
*   Talent development through competitions and workshops
    
*   Internship opportunities within the Aerospace industry to allow students to further explore their interests and aptitudes

CVSS’s ALP-ACES in the domain of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) provides the opportunity for students to better appreciate the importance of sustainability in their everyday lives. Through the ALP, students sharpen their competencies in critical, adaptive and inventive thinking, and hone their problem-solving skills through linking what they have learnt in the core subjects of Physics, Design and Technology (D&T), and Mathematics to hands-on learning in the ALP.

### ACES Modules
All lower secondary students will undergo ALP lessons conducted during curriculum time. Through theory lessons and hands-on experiences, students will learn about the principles of flight, coding, engineering principles and design thinking. These lessons will be undergirded by the theme of Sustainability as students explore its importance through various projects and activities. Students will receive the Singapore Polytechnic Young Engineers Award (ALP) on completion of the ACES modules at the end of Sec 2.

### Sustainability in D&T
Lower secondary students will also learn about sustainability as part of the D&T curriculum. Through the use of Design Thinking and application of engineering skills, our North Stars will be able to apply concepts of renewable energy and minimising material wastage in engaging projects. These projects include the designing and making of a motor operated toy car and a creative desktop stationery holder that holds both an indoor potted plant and a LED acrylic memo sheet. The students will also be making a portable solar charger to charge a set of rechargeable batteries to power these two projects.

### ACES Co-Curricular Programme
Students have the opportunity to attend STEM-related Elective Modules and Advanced Elective Modules conducted by ITE/polytechnics and go on local and overseas learning journeys to STEM-related vocational institutions/industrial companies to explore possible career options in the various industries. Talented students can take part in STEM-related competitions such as the Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition jointly organised by the Singapore Science Centre and Defence Science Organisation and National Robotics Competition, developing problem-solving and inventive thinking skills through authentic, challenging hands-on competition tasks. The most talented and interested students can further develop their aptitude and interest through participation in these co-curricular activities (CCAs) - our Aeronautics Club, Robotics Club or Environmental Science Club. Students can look forward to many more exciting learning opportunities in STEM.
