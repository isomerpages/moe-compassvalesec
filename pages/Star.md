Believing that our students have the innate potential to shine, the STAR programme provides varied and authentic experiences for North Stars to uncover and nurture their personal strengths and areas which they are passionate about. The STAR Programme is designed to grow their sphere of influence, with the following objectives: 

<u>Sec 1:</u> Start Right to be **Ready For Discovery**– North Stars will learn to know themselves well, about their personal strengths, interests and areas for growth, and also recognise that everyone is unique.

<u>Sec 2:</u>  Choose Wisely as they grow to be **Ready For Responsibility**– North Stars will learn to make informed and responsible decisions, and build positive and collaborative relationships.

<u>Sec 3: </u> Step Up to be **Ready For the Community–** North Stars will recognise their roles in the local community through gaining awareness of the needs and addressing them. They will also enhance their understanding of the post-secondary and career opportunities available to them.

<u>Sec 4/5:</u>  Emerge Stronger to be **Ready For the World**– North Stars will know how they can make a positive difference to others by preparing them to enter the post-secondary institutions, and by gaining knowledge of the developments in Singapore and beyond.
