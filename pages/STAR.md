The STAR Programme is designed to grow their sphere of influence, with the following objectives: 

**Sec 1:**
*Start Right* to be **Ready For Discovery**– North Stars will learn to know themselves well, about their personal strengths, interests and areas for growth, and also recognise that everyone is unique.

**Sec 2:** *Choose Wisely* as they grow to be **Ready For Responsibility**– North Stars will learn to make informed and responsible decisions, and build positive and collaborative relationships.

**Sec 3:** *Step Up* to be **Ready For the Community**– North Stars will recognise their roles in the local community through gaining awareness of the needs and addressing them. They will also enhance their understanding of the post-secondary and career opportunities available to them.

**Sec 4/5:** *Emerge Stronger* to be **Ready For the World**– North Stars will know how they can make a positive difference to others by preparing them to enter the post-secondary institutions, and by gaining knowledge of the developments in Singapore and beyond.**
