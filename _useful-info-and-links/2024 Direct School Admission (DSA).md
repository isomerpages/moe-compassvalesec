We invite interested Primary 6 pupils to apply to join CVSS in Secondary One 2025 through the 2024 Direct School Admission – Secondary (DSA-Sec) Exercise under the school’s distinctive programmes and talent areas.

<h3>DSA-SEC TALENTS OFFERED</h3>

  

<h4>1.  SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING AND MATHEMATICS (STEM): AERONAUTICS, CODING, ENGINEERING, SUSTAINABILITY</h4>
    

Compassvale Secondary School provides a range of exciting opportunities to develop our students’ interests, talents, and passions in STEM.&nbsp;


The school's [Applied Learning Programme in Aeronautics, Coding, Engineering and Sustainability (ACES)](https://www.compassvalesec.moe.edu.sg/our-programmes/distinctive-programmes/aeronautics-applied-learning-programme-alp/) allows students to learn flight science and develop complementary competencies like coding and engineering. This is done through formal curriculum lessons, local and overseas learning experiences, hands-on projects, and participation in national-level competitions. Students can also join the Aeronautics Club, Robotics Club, and Environmental Science Club to further their interests.&nbsp;


The school actively trains STEM talents to participate in STEM-related competitions such as the Singapore Math/Science Olympiads, Elementz Science Research Competition, Tan Kah Kee Young Inventors Award, Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition, Drone Odyssey Challenge, and more.


Experts from STEM-related industries are invited to engage our students to allow them to learn more about the latest developments. Students will also have the chance to intern with partner companies in the STEM or aviation industry to gain first-hand experience and insights into potential future careers.&nbsp;
