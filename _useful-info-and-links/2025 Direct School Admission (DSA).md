<h3><strong>COMPASSVALE SECONDARY SCHOOL</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>2025 DIRECT SCHOOL ADMISSION – SECONDARY (DSA-SEC) EXERCISE</strong></h3>
<p>We invite interested Primary 6 pupils to apply to join CVSS in Secondary
One 2026 through the 2025 Direct School Admission – Secondary (DSA-Sec)
Exercise under the school’s distinctive programmes and talent areas.</p>
<h3><strong>DSA-SEC TALENTS OFFERED</strong></h3>
<p>We offer DSA-SEC via 2 routes: STEM (Aeronautics, Environmental Science,
Robotics) and Sports &amp; Games (Floorball - Boys and Girls, Netball,
Softball - Boys, Badminton - Boys and Girls).</p>
<h3><strong><u>SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, MATHEMATICS (STEM)</u></strong></h3>
<h3><strong>1. STEM: AERONAUTICS</strong></h3>
<p>The school's Applied Learning Programme in Aeronautics, Coding, Engineering
and Sustainability (ACES) allows students to learn flight science and develop
complementary competencies like coding and engineering. This is done through
formal curriculum lessons, local and overseas learning experiences, hands-on
projects, and participation in national-level competitions. Students can
choose from the Aeronautics Club, Robotics Club, and Environmental Science
Club to further their interests.</p>

<p>Members of the Aeronautics Club further their interests in the theories
of flight and drone technology. Students engage in hands-on aeromodelling,
drone operations and flight simulation lessons to better understand how
aircrafts work and deeply appreciate the development of drone technology
in recent years. <strong>Our students do very well in national competitions like the Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition (SAFMC) and the Drone Odyssey Challenge</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>2. STEM: ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE</strong></h3>
<p>Members of the Environmental Science Club explore how science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics can be used to solve real-world problems related
to the environment and sustainability. Members conduct investigations,
for example using sensors to monitor water quality, which allow them to
apply STEM concepts. These projects encourage critical thinking, data analysis,
and creative problem-solving, making STEM more engaging and relevant to
everyday life.</p>

<h3><strong>3. STEM: ROBOTICS</strong></h3>
<p>Robotics Club members develop critical, adaptive and inventive thinking
skills as they tinker with robot sets and creatively code their creations
to complete the tasks assigned. Students participate in various robotics
competitions like the First LEGO League and the National Robotics Competition
to gain real-world problem-solving experiences.</p>
<p>Experts from STEM-related industries are regularly invited to engage our
students and allow them to learn more about the latest developments in
their respective fields. Students will also have the chance to intern with
partner companies in the STEM industries (e.g. aviation, programming, environmental
sustainability) to gain first-hand experience and insights to potential
future careers.</p>
