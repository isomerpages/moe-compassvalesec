Members of the Aeronautics Club further their interests in the theories of flight and drone technology. Students engage in hands-on aeromodelling, drone operations and flight simulation lessons to better understand how aircrafts work and deeply appreciate the development of drone technology in recent years. **Our students do very well in national competitions like the Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition (SAFMC) and the Drone Odyssey Challenge**.
