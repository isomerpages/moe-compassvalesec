# CHINA SCHOOL EXCHANGE AND CULTURAL IMMERSION LEARNING JOURNEY 2018


Forty of our students visited Suzhou Industrial Park Xinggang School and Changshu Foreign Language Middle School in Suzhou for our annual China School Exchange and Cultural Immersion programme in November 2018, accompanied by 5 teachers and Vice Principal.  At Xinggang, the students had an interesting lesson about the evolution of Chinese writings and the basic techniques of Chinese calligraphy in Xinggang. At Changshu, our students and staff were treated to a wonderful dance performance by Changshu students while Tay Juen Jie of Sec.4E3 performed a medley of contemporary pop songs on a keyboard. Our students also shared with Changshu students during a language class about lives of youths in Singapore and vice-versa. Students not only experienced a different learning environment but also built precious friendships with their China buddies through these activities.

Our students also visited numerous places of historical and cultural significance in Hangzhou, Suzhou, Nanjing, Wuxi and Shanghai such as the Confucius Temple, Mausoleum of General Yue Fei and the Municipal Museum. They were exposed to Chinese History, Literature and the Arts as they listened to the stories of heroism, loyalty, piety, wisdom, resourcefulness and resilience at these places.  Students also learnt about Chinese fan making through a hands-on workshop at the Hangzhou Fan Museum and how the local people live at the ancient Zhujiajiao Water Town in Shanghai.

All had a memorable experience taking a high-speed train from Hangzhou to Shanghai in less than an hour. Students continued to be awed by the pace of scientific and economic development through the exhibits in the Shanghai Science & Technology Museum that showcased, amongst its many exhibits, robots used in daily lives and space exploration.  They also visited Suzhou No.1 Silk Factory and learnt about how silk was produced.
