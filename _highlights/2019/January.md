# CHINA SCHOOL EXCHANGE AND CULTURAL IMMERSION LEARNING JOURNEY 2018


Forty of our students visited Suzhou Industrial Park Xinggang School and Changshu Foreign Language Middle School in Suzhou for our annual China School Exchange and Cultural Immersion programme in November 2018, accompanied by 5 teachers and Vice Principal.  At Xinggang, the students had an interesting lesson about the evolution of Chinese writings and the basic techniques of Chinese calligraphy in Xinggang. At Changshu, our students and staff were treated to a wonderful dance performance by Changshu students while Tay Juen Jie of Sec.4E3 performed a medley of contemporary pop songs on a keyboard. Our students also shared with Changshu students during a language class about lives of youths in Singapore and vice-versa. Students not only experienced a different learning environment but also built precious friendships with their China buddies through these activities.

Our students also visited numerous places of historical and cultural significance in Hangzhou, Suzhou, Nanjing, Wuxi and Shanghai such as the Confucius Temple, Mausoleum of General Yue Fei and the Municipal Museum. They were exposed to Chinese History, Literature and the Arts as they listened to the stories of heroism, loyalty, piety, wisdom, resourcefulness and resilience at these places.  Students also learnt about Chinese fan making through a hands-on workshop at the Hangzhou Fan Museum and how the local people live at the ancient Zhujiajiao Water Town in Shanghai.

All had a memorable experience taking a high-speed train from Hangzhou to Shanghai in less than an hour. Students continued to be awed by the pace of scientific and economic development through the exhibits in the Shanghai Science & Technology Museum that showcased, amongst its many exhibits, robots used in daily lives and space exploration.  They also visited Suzhou No.1 Silk Factory and learnt about how silk was produced.

# HONG KONG LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL IMMERSION 2018


From 18 to 24 November, a group of 37 students from the Sports and Uniformed Groups CCA went for a leadership development and cultural immersion learning journey to Hong Kong, accompanied by 6 teachers. The main objective is to hone leadership skills and strengthen character through outdoor activities and experiential learning. The programme is designed to provide opportunities for students to acquire leadership attributes through group dynamics.

The highlight of the trip was a very challenging 2-day 1-night trek to the peak of Tai Mo Shan (Hong Kong’s highest mountain at an elevation of 957m) and overnight at the Youth Hostel at the mountain. Our North Stars displayed perseverance, determination, courage, teamwork, grit and empathy as they were pushed beyond their physical and mental limits and motivating each other along the way as a team. Upon reaching the peak, all the students had a great sense of achievement and had developed a never give up attitude while demonstrating strong peer support.

Besides school visits, students also visited places of cultural and heritage interest such as the Sam Tung Uk Museum, Victoria Harbour and Hong Kong Island Tour, including interesting rides on the Star ferry and Hong Kong Island tram. Students also participated in an Urban Amazing Race in teams to navigate and explore areas where locals frequent.  Such an experience immersed them in the daily lives and the microhistory of Hong Kongers. Every student was given the opportunity to lead the group in the race to sharpen and test their leadership skills.

The learning journey culminated in a half day Disney World of Physics Education Programme at Hong Kong Disneyland. Students learnt about the laws of physics and applied them to create a mock up roller coaster.  They were able to understand the science behind how rides are designed in theme park and this was of course followed by a fun and enjoyable session in the park.

Throughout the trip, teachers facilitated the daily reflections with the students and helped students consolidated their learning so that they could commit and apply what they learnt to their school and personal lives.  It was truly an enriching and memorable trip for everyone, including the teacher chaperones!
