# AERONAUTICS CUM CULTURAL IMMERSION LEARNING JOURNEY TO JAPAN 2018

As part of our school’s Aeronautics Applied Learning Programme, a group of 34 students and 5 teachers went to Japan from 28 Nov to 6 Dec 2018 to learn about Japan’s aeronautics industry and latest advancements in the area of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics).  The trip including cultural immersion covers Tokyo, Mount Fuji, Matsumoto, Kyoto and Osaka. In Tokyo, students visited the Museum of Aeronautical Science, where they saw life-sized aeroplane models and learned about the history of Japan Airlines. They also visited the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), toured the facilities used for the training and selection of astronauts and had a rare glimpse into the ground operations room for Japan’s International Space Station.

The learning journey was an invaluable and enriching learning experience for our students and teachers. Through developing in our students a greater awareness of Japan’s aeronautics industry and latest science and technology innovations, the school hopes to inspire them to pursue their passion in aeronautics and STEM in future. The cultural immersion has also helped our students develop the 21st century competencies of civic literacy and global awareness as they gained a deeper appreciation of Japanese culture and heritage and make friends with local students.
