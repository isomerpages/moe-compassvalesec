# OVERSEAS SERVICE LEARNING PROGRAMME TO HO CHI MINH CITY, VIETNAM 2019
36 Sec 3 student leaders, accompanied by 5 teachers and one of our Vice-Principals went on our annual Overseas Service Learning Programme (OSLP) to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam from 8 to 15 June 2019.  As part of our Learning for Life Programme, the OSLP aims to develop community and youth leadership in our students through values-in-action projects with an overseas partner school.  Our partner school this year was An Khanh Primary School. Over 3 and a half days, our students conducted Arts & Craft, English & Mathematics and Upcycling lessons for the primary pupils as well as engaged the pupils through simple games and sports activities. They also helped refurbished the school. In a short span of 3 days, they gave the school a fresh coat of paint, painted colourful murals on the exterior walls, cleaned up the toilets thoroughly and helped in the renovation of a classroom.

We ended our service at the school and bid farewell with a gift exchange and mass performance, singing iconic Singapore songs like Singapore Town and Chan Mali Chan. The School leaders of An Khanh Primary School thanked us for the help rendered and their teaching staff were grateful for our visit.

After the school attachment, our students went on an eco-tourism tour visiting local coconut candy production factory, bee farm factories and agricultural farms.  Besides tasting local delights such as honey and fresh fruits, our students also tried harvesting Tapioca leaves and plant crops. Through these activities, they were able to gain a deeper appreciation of the tough but essential work of farmers.

To learn more about the history and culture of Vietnam, students visited the Cu Chi Tunnel and learnt about the Vietnam War through a guided tour. They also watched the renowned Vietnamese water puppet show and experienced traditional lacquer making and Vietnamese glutinous rice wrapping.

Hard and heart-work was key to the success of this trip as our North Stars gained new perspectives and appreciate the peace and comfort that they enjoy back here in Singapore. The bonds forged and valuable lessons learnt would always be unforgettable and meaningful for all involved.
