# OVERSEAS SERVICE LEARNING PROGRAMME TO HO CHI MINH CITY, VIETNAM 2019
36 Sec 3 student leaders, accompanied by 5 teachers and one of our Vice-Principals went on our annual Overseas Service Learning Programme (OSLP) to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam from 8 to 15 June 2019.  As part of our Learning for Life Programme, the OSLP aims to develop community and youth leadership in our students through values-in-action projects with an overseas partner school.  Our partner school this year was An Khanh Primary School. Over 3 and a half days, our students conducted Arts & Craft, English & Mathematics and Upcycling lessons for the primary pupils as well as engaged the pupils through simple games and sports activities. They also helped refurbished the school. In a short span of 3 days, they gave the school a fresh coat of paint, painted colourful murals on the exterior walls, cleaned up the toilets thoroughly and helped in the renovation of a classroom.

We ended our service at the school and bid farewell with a gift exchange and mass performance, singing iconic Singapore songs like Singapore Town and Chan Mali Chan. The School leaders of An Khanh Primary School thanked us for the help rendered and their teaching staff were grateful for our visit.

After the school attachment, our students went on an eco-tourism tour visiting local coconut candy production factory, bee farm factories and agricultural farms.  Besides tasting local delights such as honey and fresh fruits, our students also tried harvesting Tapioca leaves and plant crops. Through these activities, they were able to gain a deeper appreciation of the tough but essential work of farmers.

To learn more about the history and culture of Vietnam, students visited the Cu Chi Tunnel and learnt about the Vietnam War through a guided tour. They also watched the renowned Vietnamese water puppet show and experienced traditional lacquer making and Vietnamese glutinous rice wrapping.

Hard and heart-work was key to the success of this trip as our North Stars gained new perspectives and appreciate the peace and comfort that they enjoy back here in Singapore. The bonds forged and valuable lessons learnt would always be unforgettable and meaningful for all involved.

# Secondary 3 Service Learning Projects 2019

As part of our Learning for Life Programme on Community & Youth Leadership, all our Sec 3 students embarked on a semester long service learning project with the objectives to inculcate good character values and develop life skills while nurturing a greater empathy for people in need.

In this project, students were tasked as a class to identify the key needs of SunLove Home, Bright Hill Evergreen Home, Bethesda C.A.R.E Senior Activity Centre or Sengkang Community Hospital. They were then challenged to think of opportunities to serve these needs and then plan, develop and fine tune their projects under the guidance and support of their form teachers and mentors from Social Change in Action. They then carried out the projects with the various beneficiaries on CVSS CAReS Day (29 May).  The projects completed include interacting with the elderly residents at the two homes with arts & craft and games, bringing the residents from SunLove Home to Gardens by the Bay and the eldely guests from Bethesda CARE SAC to Malay Heritage Centre, cheering up patients through performances at Sengkang Community Hospital wards and hosting a visit to our school for elderly residents who live near our school.

Students braved myriad obstacles and demonstrated grit to overcome these hurdles. They seized opportunities to exercise social responsibility and contribute meaningfully to their chosen community.  The service learning project culminated in students sharing their experiences and reflections with their peers from other classes and inspiring the next batch of students who will be embarking on their projects next year.

# Secondary 1 & 2 Green Compass Programme 2019


As climate change becomes a central issue in the world today, it is important that students are exposed to ways of reducing consumption of new products by making new use of everyday items that are discarded. This is part of the UNESCO Sustainable Development Goals.

As part of our school’s Green Compass Programme, all Sec 1 students attended a talk on Waste Management by NEA and embarked on a recyclables collection drive from 36 HDB blocks near our school.  They also helped spread awareness on environmental issues and waste management by giving out NEA pamphlets to all the residents. All Sec 2 students went through a series of upcycling workshops and talks by TERRA Organisation, which include workshops on creating juice carton wallets, upholstery tissue paper holder and pencil cases made of recycled plastic bottles. Besides acquiring the skills of upcycling, students were given insight into the extent of environmental pollution and how their little actions could impact climate change in a big way.

# Commendation Award in Design for Good Youth Competition 2019
  
A group of students from our Community Youth Leaders Club took part in the annual Design for Good Youth Competition organized by Make the Change on 1 Nov 2019 and clinched a **Commendation Award** among over 600 entries from 28 secondary school.

The Design for Good Youth Competition, organised by Make The Change (a social enterprise with a marketing, advertising and design school), is a yearly event that encourages secondary school students to use their creativity, arts and design to address a social cause. In collaboration with the Media Literacy Council, this year’s competition was to create awareness of the better use of the internet and promoting the values of ‘Be Kind, Be Smart and Be Safe’.

Our students designed a communicative poster that advocates for better internet use and compels people to take action.
