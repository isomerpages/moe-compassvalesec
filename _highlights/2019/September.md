# OVERSEAS SERVICE LEARNING PROGRAMME TO HO CHI MINH CITY, VIETNAM 2019
36 Sec 3 student leaders, accompanied by 5 teachers and one of our Vice-Principals went on our annual Overseas Service Learning Programme (OSLP) to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam from 8 to 15 June 2019.  As part of our Learning for Life Programme, the OSLP aims to develop community and youth leadership in our students through values-in-action projects with an overseas partner school.  Our partner school this year was An Khanh Primary School. Over 3 and a half days, our students conducted Arts & Craft, English & Mathematics and Upcycling lessons for the primary pupils as well as engaged the pupils through simple games and sports activities. They also helped refurbished the school. In a short span of 3 days, they gave the school a fresh coat of paint, painted colourful murals on the exterior walls, cleaned up the toilets thoroughly and helped in the renovation of a classroom.
