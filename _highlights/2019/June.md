This year’s SAFMC marked a record of 498 teams and close to 1,800 participants vying for top honours and awards in five broad categories, namely Paper Planes (for primary schools), Unpowered Gliders, Radio Controlled Flights, Autonomous Flights and Unconventional Flying Machines.  In the **Unpowered Gliders category**, one of our teams, the Soarers produced the best overall performance, out-performing more than 150 teams in the combined results of flight distance, presentation, theory of flight and creativity to clinch the **Championship Award, 1st Placing**!  It is the second successive year that our school clinches the pinnacle award in this category.
