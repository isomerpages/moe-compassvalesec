# Champions at Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition 2019
  

A year after sweeping multiple awards in the Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition 2018, our North Stars have done it again! After a week of intense competition, our North Stars clinched a total of 8 awards in various categories.

This year’s SAFMC marked a record of 498 teams and close to 1,800 participants vying for top honours and awards in five broad categories, namely Paper Planes (for primary schools), Unpowered Gliders, Radio Controlled Flights, Autonomous Flights and Unconventional Flying Machines.  In the **Unpowered Gliders category**, one of our teams, the Soarers produced the best overall performance, out-performing more than 150 teams in the combined results of flight distance, presentation, theory of flight and creativity to clinch the **Championship Award, 1st Placing**!  It is the second successive year that our school clinches the pinnacle award in this category.

In addition, our students’ hard work and commitment were also rewarded as they performed consistently well over five days of competition to clinch another seven awards across three different categories:

*   **Category B: Unpowered Gliders - Championship Award, 1st placing; Best Performance Award, 1st placing; Best Aesthetic Award, 1st placing; Most Creative Award, 2nd placing**
*   **Category C: Fixed Wing Radio Controlled Flight / First Person View Flight - Championship Award (Fixed Wing RC Flight), 3rd placing; Best Performance Award (Fixed Wing RC Flight), 2nd placing; Best Performance Award (FPV Flight), 4th placing**
*   **Category D: Semi-Autonomous / Autonomous Flight - Championship Award (Semi-Autonomous), 3rd placing**

Our Category D team, comprising Koh Tze Wang (2E2), Khiew An Kai (4E2) and Valerie Lee (4E3), was the only secondary school team that took part in the Semi-Autonomous Flight, punching fearlessly above their weight against teams from the polytechnics and universities.

All our participating teams displayed enthusiasm, commitment and resilience. Not only did the teams share resources and helped one another to improve their planes, they also cheered and spurred each other on during the competition, showing great unity and the North Star spirit. Nevertheless, there is still hard work to be done as our North Stars strive to do even better in the Presentation and Flight Theory components next year.  May our North Stars shine even brighter next year.
