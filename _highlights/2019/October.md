# EAST ZONE A\*STAR SCIENCE FAIR AND 18TH ELEMENTZ SCIENCE RESEARCH COMPETITION 2019
  

The **East Zone A*Star Science Fair** is an annual event organised by Victoria Junior College to give secondary school students the experience of conducting an investigative Science project and exhibit and share their findings with others.

Participants had to plan an investigation and perform experiments to verify their hypotheses. They then had to produce a poster and present their projects to a panel of judges.  73 teams took part in the fair this year across three categories. Our school sent in one team of Sec 3 students and 2 teams of Sec 2 students with three projects entitled “Biodegradable Oil Absorbents”, "Investigating the Anti-microbial Properties of Banana Peels against Oral Bacteria” and “Investigation into the Suitability of Using Food Waste to Build a Microbial Fuel Cell” respectively.  The project on “Biodegradable Oil Absorbents” by our Sec 3 team clinched a **Silver Award!**

The **Elementz Science Research Competition** is an annual event organised by Anderson Secondary School that provides a platform for students from primary and secondary schools (lower secondary levels) who have conducted scientific research to showcase their findings.  Participants had to conceptualize an investigative-type project based on the theme "Changing the World, One Idea at a Time".  They then had to perform experiments and produce a poster for submission, and finally give a presentation on their projects to a panel of three judges.  94 teams participated in the event this year. Our school sent two teams of Sec 2 students with the projects titled "From Waste to Paste” and “Investigation into the Suitability of Using Food Waste to Build a Microbial Fuel Cell”.  One of the teams clinched a **Gold award**!

# DRONE ODYSSEY CHALLENGE 2019
  
Our Aeronautics Club students took part in the Drone Odyssey Challenge 2019 competition organised by the Singapore Science Centre from 9 – 12 July 2019. This is an annual, nation-wide competition that attracts the participation of many schools such as Catholic High School, Tanjong Katong Girls’ School, Victoria School and CHIJ (Toa Payoh) Secondary School. 

Our school sent a total of 10 teams with 3 members each - 5 teams for Category B1 Parrot Drone Challenge and 5 teams for Category B2 Tello Drone Challenge.   Category B1 contestants had to make use of a programming app, Tynker to code and maneuver their Parrot drones around 5 checkpoints and take photos of them in the quickest time possible. Category B2 contestants had to make use of another programming app, Tello Edu to code and maneuver their Tello drones in search of ‘monsters’ within a flying area using the drone’s depth sensor function. All contestants also had to prepare a presentation to showcase their competition learning experience and aeronautics knowledge.

Two of our teams achieved **Merit Awards** in the presentation segment of the competition. Team 4, comprising Damian Soon (3E1), Keane Tan (2E1) and Killian Sen (1N3), won the Category B1 Best Learning Journey Merit Award. Team 10 comprising Raven Ho (3E3), Foo Siao Rou (3E3) and Chen Xuanyin (3E1), won the Category B2 Best Presentation Merit Award. Each of the 2 teams took home a prize of $300 Cash, Merit Award Medals and sponsored products.

# Republic Polytechnic (RP) Renesas Grand Prix Competition 2019

The RP Renesas Grand Prix Competition 2019 is an event organised by Republic Polytechnic, supported by Renesas Electronics (Singapore) Pte Ltd for secondary school and tertiary institution to develop their passion for electronics. The competition was held on 10-13 September at Republic Polytechnic. Despite being their first attempt and inexperience, our students demonstrated resilience, strong analytical skills and teamwork over 4 days andclinched **second placing** in this competition!

In this competition, students were required to programme a microcontroller racing car to race on an  
F1-style racing track with many sharp turns, twisty sections and ramps. To complete the race course in the fastest time possible, the car has to decelerate to negotiate the bends and turns and accelerate quickly thereafter.

To prepare for the competition, our students attended a 3-day training workshop at Republic Polytechnic to tune their cars and learn C-programming. They also spent several afternoons to test and fine-tune their racing cars at the track. Throughout the entire process, our students demonstrated critical and inventive thinking. They also showed great resilience and strong teamwork as they weathered repeated failures of unsuccessful test runs and collaborated to devise solutions. All of these indeed exemplify the indomitable North Star spirit expected of all our students!
