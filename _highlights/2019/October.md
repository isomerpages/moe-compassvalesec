Our school sent a total of 10 teams with 3 members each - 5 teams for Category B1 Parrot Drone Challenge and 5 teams for Category B2 Tello Drone Challenge.   Category B1 contestants had to make use of a programming app, Tynker to code and maneuver their Parrot drones around 5 checkpoints and take photos of them in the quickest time possible. Category B2 contestants had to make use of another programming app, Tello Edu to code and maneuver their Tello drones in search of ‘monsters’ within a flying area using the drone’s depth sensor function. All contestants also had to prepare a presentation to showcase their competition learning experience and aeronautics knowledge.

In this competition, students were required to programme a microcontroller racing car to race on an  
F1-style racing track with many sharp turns, twisty sections and ramps. To complete the race course in the fastest time possible, the car has to decelerate to negotiate the bends and turns and accelerate quickly thereafter.

To prepare for the competition, our students attended a 3-day training workshop at Republic Polytechnic to tune their cars and learn C-programming. They also spent several afternoons to test and fine-tune their racing cars at the track. Throughout the entire process, our students demonstrated critical and inventive thinking. They also showed great resilience and strong teamwork as they weathered repeated failures of unsuccessful test runs and collaborated to devise solutions. All of these indeed exemplify the indomitable North Star spirit expected of all our students!
