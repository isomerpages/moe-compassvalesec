# EAST ZONE A\*STAR SCIENCE FAIR AND 18TH ELEMENTZ SCIENCE RESEARCH COMPETITION 2019


  

The **East Zone A*Star Science Fair** is an annual event organised by Victoria Junior College to give secondary school students the experience of conducting an investigative Science project and exhibit and share their findings with others.

Participants had to plan an investigation and perform experiments to verify their hypotheses. They then had to produce a poster and present their projects to a panel of judges.  73 teams took part in the fair this year across three categories. Our school sent in one team of Sec 3 students and 2 teams of Sec 2 students with three projects entitled “Biodegradable Oil Absorbents”, "Investigating the Anti-microbial Properties of Banana Peels against Oral Bacteria” and “Investigation into the Suitability of Using Food Waste to Build a Microbial Fuel Cell” respectively.  The project on “Biodegradable Oil Absorbents” by our Sec 3 team clinched a **Silver Award!**

The **Elementz Science Research Competition** is an annual event organised by Anderson Secondary School that provides a platform for students from primary and secondary schools (lower secondary levels) who have conducted scientific research to showcase their findings.  Participants had to conceptualize an investigative-type project based on the theme "Changing the World, One Idea at a Time".  They then had to perform experiments and produce a poster for submission, and finally give a presentation on their projects to a panel of three judges.  94 teams participated in the event this year. Our school sent two teams of Sec 2 students with the projects titled "From Waste to Paste” and “Investigation into the Suitability of Using Food Waste to Build a Microbial Fuel Cell”.  One of the teams clinched a **Gold award**!
