In this competition, students were required to programme a microcontroller racing car to race on an  
F1-style racing track with many sharp turns, twisty sections and ramps. To complete the race course in the fastest time possible, the car has to decelerate to negotiate the bends and turns and accelerate quickly thereafter.

To prepare for the competition, our students attended a 3-day training workshop at Republic Polytechnic to tune their cars and learn C-programming. They also spent several afternoons to test and fine-tune their racing cars at the track. Throughout the entire process, our students demonstrated critical and inventive thinking. They also showed great resilience and strong teamwork as they weathered repeated failures of unsuccessful test runs and collaborated to devise solutions. All of these indeed exemplify the indomitable North Star spirit expected of all our students!

As part of the Malay Language Unit’s efforts in making Malay Language learning attractive, fun and purposeful, teachers organised regular ‘Games’ Days’ where students engaged in playing games such as the Malay Scrabble. In this adaptation of the classic board game, students build as many words as they can from a pile of tiles within the allocated time. In addition to having a reasonable knowledge of vocabulary, students also honed their confidence, calmness and the ability to strategize their game-play by purposeful interceptions and quick thinking. The students’ competitive spirit were further piqued when the best students were selected to represent their classes at the inter-class Malay Scrabble competition where the winners were chosen to represent the school at the above inter-schools competition.  Indeed, as fun as it was, the game was challenging and we faced stiff competition from our counterparts in the cluster.

The ML Unit hopes that our students’ joy of learning the language through these games and activities was ignited, as there is much they can gain from learning the Malay language. Just as the renowned psycholinguist Frank Smith would say, “One language sets you in a corridor for life. Two languages open every door along the way.”

# SYNER-G! 2019
Our lower secondary students in the Environment Club participated in the **G!nnovation Challenge**, a competition where schools in the North East district came up with innovative solutions to tackle environmental issues.  It is part of ‘SYNER-G! 2019’, an inaugural event jointly organised by North East CDC and NEA on 21 Sep 2019 at Pasir Ris Sports Centre. The event aims to create environmental awareness among the young generation and rally the young to be more mindful of our precious resources. There was also a carnival featuring schools environmental projects, interactive game booths and hands-on upcycling workshops.

This year, based on the theme of Zero Waste, students were tasked to tackle one of four waste challenges (E-waste, Packaging Waste, Food Waste and Recycle Right).  In preparation for the challenge, our students used the design thinking framework to define a waste problem that they wanted to tackle. They then thought of innovative solutions for the problem and implemented their solutions in school. They also conducted campaigns during recess and through Instagram and Facebook to advocate environmental messages to their peers. The success of the campaigns was measured through an online survey and our students presented their findings at the Syner-g! event.

One of our teams, Plasti-Case which did a project on upcycling plastic waste to make a pouch received good response for their project and representatives from ActiveSG had expressed interest to collaborate with the team to see how to bring their idea forward.  ActiveSG, Corporate Investment Partnerships, oversees ActiveWallet, ActiveSG Merchandise & lifestyle offerings in Sports Centres. They also encourage and advocate environmental sustainability.
