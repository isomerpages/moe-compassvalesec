# EAST ZONE A\*STAR SCIENCE FAIR AND 18TH ELEMENTZ SCIENCE RESEARCH COMPETITION 2019
  

The **East Zone A*Star Science Fair** is an annual event organised by Victoria Junior College to give secondary school students the experience of conducting an investigative Science project and exhibit and share their findings with others.

Participants had to plan an investigation and perform experiments to verify their hypotheses. They then had to produce a poster and present their projects to a panel of judges.  73 teams took part in the fair this year across three categories. Our school sent in one team of Sec 3 students and 2 teams of Sec 2 students with three projects entitled “Biodegradable Oil Absorbents”, "Investigating the Anti-microbial Properties of Banana Peels against Oral Bacteria” and “Investigation into the Suitability of Using Food Waste to Build a Microbial Fuel Cell” respectively.  The project on “Biodegradable Oil Absorbents” by our Sec 3 team clinched a **Silver Award!**

Our school sent a total of 10 teams with 3 members each - 5 teams for Category B1 Parrot Drone Challenge and 5 teams for Category B2 Tello Drone Challenge.   Category B1 contestants had to make use of a programming app, Tynker to code and maneuver their Parrot drones around 5 checkpoints and take photos of them in the quickest time possible. Category B2 contestants had to make use of another programming app, Tello Edu to code and maneuver their Tello drones in search of ‘monsters’ within a flying area using the drone’s depth sensor function. All contestants also had to prepare a presentation to showcase their competition learning experience and aeronautics knowledge.
