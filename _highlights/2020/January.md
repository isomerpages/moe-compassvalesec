# Performing Arts/School Exchange/Cultural Immersion Learning Journey to China

35 students from our performing arts CCA, accompanied by 6 teachers went on the above learning journey to Suzhou/Hangzhou/ Shanghai, China from 15 to 22 November 2019. We visited the Hangzhou Art School, Suzhou Industrial Park Xinggang School and Changshu Foreign Language Junior Middle School with the objectives of enhancing our students’ appreciation for performing arts and providing them immersion experience.

 At Hangzhou Art School, our students were awed with a spectacular display of various performance items from their China counterparts, and teaching pointers were exchanged between both schools after both schools had presented their performances.

 Through the interactions with their Chinese buddies at these three schools, our students not only experienced a different learning environment but also forged precious friendships.  Our students also visited many places of historical and cultural significance in Hangzhou, Suzhou and Shanghai such as the West Lake, Mausoleum of General Yue Fei, Lei Feng Pagoda, Master-of-the-net Garden and the Bund. They were exposed to Chinese history, literature, folklore and the arts as they toured these places and watched world-class cultural performances like the Song Dynasty Musical Performance and “Impressions of West Lake”.

 In addition, the students were treated to a Suzhou Pingtan performance at a teahouse, where they enjoyed the popular musical/oral art form in southern Jiangsu. The two most memorable performances were the Hangzhou outdoor performance and the ERA Intersection of Time Acrobatic Show. Our students also had hands-on lesson in traditional Chinese fan making at the Hangzhou Fan Museum and a taste of the local lifestyle at the idyllic Nanxun Old Town.

 Throughout the trip, the teachers facilitated the daily reflections with the students and helped them consolidate their learning, so as to deepen their development of the 21st century competencies of global awareness, cross-cultural skills and sensitivities. It was truly an enriching and memorable trip for everyone as lasting friendships and precious memories were forged.
 
# AERONAUTICS ALP CUM CULTURAL IMMERSION LEARNING JOURNEY TO JAPAN 2019
As part of our school’s Aeronautics Applied Learning Programme, a group of 36 students and 6 teachers went to Japan from 22 Nov to 1 Dec 2019 to learn more about the aviation/aeronautics industry and advancements in the area of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). The trip covered various parts of Japan, including Fukuoka, Nagasaki, Kumamoto, Osaka, Nagoya, Hamamatsu and Tokyo.

We visited many aviation museums in the various cities and regions such as the Tachiarai Peace Memorial Museum in Kyushu, Kakamigahara Flight and Space Museum in Gifu, Aichi Aviation Museum and Mitsubishi Regional Jet Museum in Gifu prefecture, JASDF Hamamatsu Air Base Museum in Hamamatsu and Tokorozawa Aviation Museum in Saitama.  Through the museum visits, we learnt about the invention and history of aviation in general and in Japan, the Kamikazes in Japan’s World War II history, the physics of flight and aeronautics, the development and manufacture of modern aircrafts in Japan’s aviation industry.

We also visited Fukuoka and Nagoya airports to learn about airport operations. In Fukuoka, we went on a guided back-end of Fukuoka airport where we observed the day-to-day operations of ground crew as they prepare for an airplane’s departure and arrival. We were also treated to a bus tour of the runway and witness the take-off and landing of various aircrafts up close from a special gallery not open to the public. In Nagoya airport, we visited the Flight of Dreams theatre and All Nippon Airways (ANA) hangar. At the theatre, we came up close to a real Boeing 787 Dreamliner parked in the theatre.  At the hangar, we saw first-hand how the various aircrafts belonging to ANA were serviced and repaired. The trip ended with a 2 hour hands-on drone workshop by drone experts where we tried our hands in controlling powerful drones and learnt about how Japan makes use of drones in the agricultural industry.

Besides aeronautics, we visited the Kewpie industrial plant in Kyushu where we learnt about the innovative automation and quality assurance in the production line of mayonnaise.  We also visited several places of historical and cultural interest and experienced Japanese way of life. These include visiting Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum and Peace Park to learn about the tragedies of atomic bombs in World War II and hope for peace; viewing Mount Aso, one of the largest active volcanoes in the world; taking the Shinkansen bullet train from Fukuoka to Osaka; and spending a night of homestay in Shirakawa-go, a UNESCO world heritage site.

School visit is of course a must and we visited Suita Higashi Senior High School in Osaka, with the hope of establishing a long term partnership in cultural exchange.  We were welcomed by the Principal and staff, went on a tour of the brand new school campus, observed lessons in progress and enjoyed a special interaction session with Japanese students.  Our students taught the Japanese students how to fly a paper glider and the Japanese students in turn hosted quizzes and games.

The learning journey was an eye-opening and enriching learning experience for all. It has certainly raised our students’ interest in aeronautics and STEM further, as well as helped them develop the 21st century competencies of civic literacy, global awareness and cross cultural sensitivities as they gained a deeper appreciation of Japanese culture and history.
