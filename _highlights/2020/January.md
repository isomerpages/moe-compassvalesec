# Performing Arts/School Exchange/Cultural Immersion Learning Journey to China

35 students from our performing arts CCA, accompanied by 6 teachers went on the above learning journey to Suzhou/Hangzhou/ Shanghai, China from 15 to 22 November 2019. We visited the Hangzhou Art School, Suzhou Industrial Park Xinggang School and Changshu Foreign Language Junior Middle School with the objectives of enhancing our students’ appreciation for performing arts and providing them immersion experience.

 At Hangzhou Art School, our students were awed with a spectacular display of various performance items from their China counterparts, and teaching pointers were exchanged between both schools after both schools had presented their performances.

 At Xinggang School, the students attended two interesting lessons on Chinese idioms and the Suzhou dialect which they enjoyed immensely.

 At Changshu, our host indulged us with delectable local snacks and a medley of performances during the welcome ceremony.  Our students also participated in two traditional art and craft lessons: one group learnt sewing while the other group crafted customised wired artwork.

 Through the interactions with their Chinese buddies at these three schools, our students not only experienced a different learning environment but also forged precious friendships.  Our students also visited many places of historical and cultural significance in Hangzhou, Suzhou and Shanghai such as the West Lake, Mausoleum of General Yue Fei, Lei Feng Pagoda, Master-of-the-net Garden and the Bund. They were exposed to Chinese history, literature, folklore and the arts as they toured these places and watched world-class cultural performances like the Song Dynasty Musical Performance and “Impressions of West Lake”.

 In addition, the students were treated to a Suzhou Pingtan performance at a teahouse, where they enjoyed the popular musical/oral art form in southern Jiangsu. The two most memorable performances were the Hangzhou outdoor performance and the ERA Intersection of Time Acrobatic Show. Our students also had hands-on lesson in traditional Chinese fan making at the Hangzhou Fan Museum and a taste of the local lifestyle at the idyllic Nanxun Old Town.

 Throughout the trip, the teachers facilitated the daily reflections with the students and helped them consolidate their learning, so as to deepen their development of the 21st century competencies of global awareness, cross-cultural skills and sensitivities. It was truly an enriching and memorable trip for everyone as lasting friendships and precious memories were forged.
