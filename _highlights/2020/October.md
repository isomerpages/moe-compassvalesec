# CVSS The Futurist Webinar Series 2020 – Thriving Amidst Uncertainties
The COVID-19 pandemic has taken the world by storm and caused much disruptions to many sectors of the economy both locally and globally. To help our North Stars deal with these changes and uncertainties, the school’s Character and Citizenship Education department collaborated with MOE’s Education and Career Guidance Unit to organise our school’s first ever _‘The Futurist Webinar Series’_ for all Sec 4E5N and 4NA students, focussing on the theme *Thriving Amidst Uncertainties’.*

The webinar was held during the CCE period on 13 August 2020. It was attended by our students, teachers and our school’s ECG counsellor, Ms Wang Pheck Hoon as well as Mdm Choy Wai Yin, Director of MOE’s Guidance Branch at the Student Development Curriculum Division and Mrs Priscillia Chan, Project Director for ECG at MOE’s Guidance Branch. Professionals from Google Singapore were invited to speak at the webinar - Ms Shikin Hamid, APAC Program Manager and Ms Goh WiWi, Chief of Staff, Strategy and Operations, shared with the students their insights on the changes in the world of work, the emerging sectors in the economy, as well as how we could tap on opportunities amidst challenges and the skillsets that employers are looking for. The informal webinar ended with an engaging Q&A segment where a number of our students impressed the presenters with their confident articulation of well-thought questions about the world of work.  All the students have benefitted much from the session and this was aptly summed up in one of the students’ reflection – ‘_It is important to adapt to changes, improve when things go wrong and do not be afraid to try new things.’

As a follow up, form teachers encouraged our North Stars to reflect on their education and career plans as well as reinforcing the importance of staying positive and adaptable amidst the changes and uncertainties of the pandemic.

# Overall Champions in Historical Scene Investigation Challenge 2020

In August, NLB and MOE CPDD Humanities branch jointly organised the Historical Scene Investigation (HSI) Challenge 2020 in which a team of 4 Lower Secondary students from each secondary school had to conduct independent research on their own on a selected topic based on a given theme, and to produce a poster based on their research and collected data over one and a half months.

Despite the challenges brought about by the circuit breaker measures with the teacher mentors for our team only managing to have a few face-to-face sessions with them in school, our students were able to work independently and exercise their creativity online to complete their project.

We are delighted that our North Stars came in **1st place as the Overall Champion**, beating close to 80 participating schools including many top schools. 30 schools obtained Bronze, 20 schools obtained Silver and 10 schools obtained Gold awards with 3 schools in the top 3 and we were the champions among the top 3 schools!

Our team comprises Lydia Ye Yan Han, Muhammad Taha Firdaus Bin Askarali Ahammed Thagavi, Pham Yi Xin Chezanne and Fei Weijie Gavin (all from Sec 2E1).  The team will receive $400 worth of Kinokuniya vouchers and a champion trophy.

# Best G!nnovation Team in NEA G!nnovation Challenge 2020
The G!nnovation Challenge is an annual competition organized by NEA for schools to come up with innovative solutions to solve local environmental challenges. This challenge aims to promote environmental ownership through the application of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, foster collaboration with peers to develop solutions and bring about positive impact to the community.

This year, two teams from our school took part in the challenge which revolved around the theme ‘Towards Zero Waste: The Game Changer’. Our students tackled environmental issues by coming up with game-changing solutions and incorporating elements of STEM in their project. To prepare for this challenge, our students created Apps by learning how to use the MIT App inventor software during the September school holidays and collaborated online to prepare their presentation and poster.

The team conceptualized and created an App to reduce plastic waste in the community and received $300 worth of Popular vouchers and a Goodie bag from the organisers.
