# CVSS The Futurist Webinar Series 2020 – Thriving Amidst Uncertainties
The COVID-19 pandemic has taken the world by storm and caused much disruptions to many sectors of the economy both locally and globally. To help our North Stars deal with these changes and uncertainties, the school’s Character and Citizenship Education department collaborated with MOE’s Education and Career Guidance Unit to organise our school’s first ever _‘The Futurist Webinar Series’_ for all Sec 4E5N and 4NA students, focussing on the theme *Thriving Amidst Uncertainties’.*

The webinar was held during the CCE period on 13 August 2020. It was attended by our students, teachers and our school’s ECG counsellor, Ms Wang Pheck Hoon as well as Mdm Choy Wai Yin, Director of MOE’s Guidance Branch at the Student Development Curriculum Division and Mrs Priscillia Chan, Project Director for ECG at MOE’s Guidance Branch. Professionals from Google Singapore were invited to speak at the webinar - Ms Shikin Hamid, APAC Program Manager and Ms Goh WiWi, Chief of Staff, Strategy and Operations, shared with the students their insights on the changes in the world of work, the emerging sectors in the economy, as well as how we could tap on opportunities amidst challenges and the skillsets that employers are looking for. The informal webinar ended with an engaging Q&A segment where a number of our students impressed the presenters with their confident articulation of well-thought questions about the world of work.  All the students have benefitted much from the session and this was aptly summed up in one of the students’ reflection – ‘_It is important to adapt to changes, improve when things go wrong and do not be afraid to try new things.’

As a follow up, form teachers encouraged our North Stars to reflect on their education and career plans as well as reinforcing the importance of staying positive and adaptable amidst the changes and uncertainties of the pandemic.

# Overall Champions in Historical Scene Investigation Challenge 2020

In August, NLB and MOE CPDD Humanities branch jointly organised the Historical Scene Investigation (HSI) Challenge 2020 in which a team of 4 Lower Secondary students from each secondary school had to conduct independent research on their own on a selected topic based on a given theme, and to produce a poster based on their research and collected data over one and a half months.

# Teachers’ Day Celebrations 2020: HBL - Heroes Behind Learners

Our school celebrated Teachers’ Day on 3 September this year with the theme ‘Heroes Behind Learners’ – a play on the acronym HBL for Home-Based Learning. The event was organised in tandem with the national movement to acknowledge teachers for their roles in fighting COVID-19. Hence, the celebrations focused on recognising and celebrating the tireless efforts of our teachers to ensure their students continued learning, felt safe and received mental and emotional support in this difficult year.

With safe management measures in place, the celebrations was brought from the traditional hall concert to the classroom and teachers joined their form classes to enjoy the programme from their respective classrooms through google meet. Key personnel also joined the classes they teach. The celebrations started with an opening address by our Vice-Principal, Ms Jacelyn Kee on behalf of our school leaders and the Teachers Day message from our Minister for Education, Mr Lawrence Wong.  The address and message conveyed thanks accorded to the teachers for overcoming adversity and ensuring our learners continued to learn.

This was followed by a virtual concert which began on a cheerful and thankful note with videos of student performances, interspersed with dedications from MOE HQ, parents and students, and several interactive elements like a Kahoot Game where students were tested on the knowledge of their teachers’ childhood, interests and family. The Student Councillors also wrote, performed and edited a video skit which reflected the efforts and challenges faced by our CVSS teachers during the Circuit breaker.

The councilors also creatively utilized various online platforms to prepare dedications and cards for the teachers in place of the traditional handwritten notes. As the student population sent in their dedications through google forms, the councilors collated, organized and placed them on digital canvases with scrapbooking apps like Canva and Graphionica before printing them. Class leaders also led their classes to organize a mini live dedication to their FTs in their classrooms when they gave out the cards. The day ended on a high and meaningful note and will be remembered as a unique and unusual Teachers Day celebrations in the history of the school.
