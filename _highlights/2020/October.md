# CVSS The Futurist Webinar Series 2020 – Thriving Amidst Uncertainties
The COVID-19 pandemic has taken the world by storm and caused much disruptions to many sectors of the economy both locally and globally. To help our North Stars deal with these changes and uncertainties, the school’s Character and Citizenship Education department collaborated with MOE’s Education and Career Guidance Unit to organise our school’s first ever _‘The Futurist Webinar Series’_ for all Sec 4E5N and 4NA students, focussing on the theme *Thriving Amidst Uncertainties’.*

The webinar was held during the CCE period on 13 August 2020. It was attended by our students, teachers and our school’s ECG counsellor, Ms Wang Pheck Hoon as well as Mdm Choy Wai Yin, Director of MOE’s Guidance Branch at the Student Development Curriculum Division and Mrs Priscillia Chan, Project Director for ECG at MOE’s Guidance Branch. Professionals from Google Singapore were invited to speak at the webinar - Ms Shikin Hamid, APAC Program Manager and Ms Goh WiWi, Chief of Staff, Strategy and Operations, shared with the students their insights on the changes in the world of work, the emerging sectors in the economy, as well as how we could tap on opportunities amidst challenges and the skillsets that employers are looking for. The informal webinar ended with an engaging Q&A segment where a number of our students impressed the presenters with their confident articulation of well-thought questions about the world of work.  All the students have benefitted much from the session and this was aptly summed up in one of the students’ reflection – ‘_It is important to adapt to changes, improve when things go wrong and do not be afraid to try new things.’

As a follow up, form teachers encouraged our North Stars to reflect on their education and career plans as well as reinforcing the importance of staying positive and adaptable amidst the changes and uncertainties of the pandemic.
