# National Story Challenge 2015

There was no safety in script; there was little time to ponder. Despite the challenges set up by the competition, Ethaniel Low Shane Jaswan of Sec 3G let his imagination take flight in the National Story Challenge 2015, and emerged first runner-up in the Individual Category!  
  
The National Story Challenge, presented by the National Library Board and organised by The Theatre Practice, is an original improvisational storytelling competition that aims to promote eloquence and a healthy interest in languages.  
This is a commendable achievement as Ethaniel has put up a good performance against the teams from five other schools, including River Valley High School. Also, it is the first time that we have sent students to represent CVSS in the Individual Category.  
  
Ethaniel displayed great confidence, creativity and composure in the crafting and delivery of his stories. He reacted spontaneously to the topics and prompts given in a seamless mix of narration and performing skills. He also showed great resilience amid the stiff competition put up by all the participating schools throughout the entire competition.  
This is one of the fruits of the EL Department's Speech & Drama Programme and the teachers' consistent effort in training our students in oral presentations.  
  
Congratulations to Ethaniel and the EL Department!

# Champions at the ITE Skills Challenge 2015--Robotics Category

In a great show of teamwork, creativity and problem-solving skills, four North Stars from the PA/AVA (Robotics) Club emerged Champions in the Robotics Challenge organised by the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) on March 2. This is an extremely laudable achievement by this young team as it is their first time taking part in this competition.  
  
The ITE Skills Challenge is a skills competition in Engineering Science and Technology (S&T) organised specifically for the Normal Course students. This competition provides a platform for participants to exhibit their talents and capabilities in S&T as they compete against one other in a fun and exciting manner.  
  
Congratulations to the PA/AVA (Robotics) Club! We hope that this achievement will inspire all North Stars to create new breakthroughs in all aspects of their learning.
