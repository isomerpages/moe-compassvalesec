# 15 days to go: Shining bright like the North Star

To celebrate the hosting of the 28th SEA Games, students at Compassvale Secondary School used a variety of recycled coloured bottle caps for the formation of number “15”. It is a very special number for the school in 2015 as she marks the 15th year of establishment since 2000.

The project brings together the Secondary Two students to contribute to the project. We want to inculcate in them the value of teamwork, and help them realise the power of an individual in contributing to the success of a team.

The plethora of colours used to create the artwork symbolises diversity in unity. The round bottle caps also symbolises harmony in the nation.

“All the best! Do Singapore proud! One Team Singapore!” cheered the students from the school.
