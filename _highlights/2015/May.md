# 15 days to go: Shining bright like the North Star

To celebrate the hosting of the 28th SEA Games, students at Compassvale Secondary School used a variety of recycled coloured bottle caps for the formation of number “15”. It is a very special number for the school in 2015 as she marks the 15th year of establishment since 2000.

The project brings together the Secondary Two students to contribute to the project. We want to inculcate in them the value of teamwork, and help them realise the power of an individual in contributing to the success of a team.

The plethora of colours used to create the artwork symbolises diversity in unity. The round bottle caps also symbolises harmony in the nation.

“All the best! Do Singapore proud! One Team Singapore!” cheered the students from the school.

# Results of the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation 2015
2015 is indeed a special year for CVSS. Adding to the celebratory mood of the 15th anniversary of the school is the spectacular results of the performing arts students at the SYF. CVSS has received the best SYF results in the history of the school!

This year, the Drama, Dance and Choir attained the Certificate of Distinction, while the Band received the Certificate of Accomplishment. These impressive results would not have been possible without the determination of the students, and the dedication of the coaches and the teachers in-charge to bring out the best in them. North Stars have indeed shone brightly on the stages of the Singapore Youth Festival.

North Stars, may you continue to keep the stars in you shining, and your passion for the arts burning!
