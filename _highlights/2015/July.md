# National Environment and Water Quiz

Three Secondary 2 students emerged 3rd in place for the team category (for non-IP schools) of the annual National Environment and Water Quiz 2015.  The objective of the Quiz is to create awareness in our students – to inform them of their responsibilities in protecting and caring for the environment as well as in keeping it clean and green. 

This is the first time that CVSS has won a team prize in the Quiz that is organised by Nan Hua High School with the support of the National Environment Agency and Tetra Pak South East Asia Pte Ltd. Our team triumphed over 47 other non-IP secondary schools.

CVSS was represented by three talented North Stars – Vidhi Mahajan from Sec 2H, as well as Cheong Huan Feng and Darryl Chow from Sec 2E. Vidhi also emerged as the 9th top scorer in the Individual category, beating more than 120 students.

Vidhi, Huan Feng and Darryl demonstrated resilience in their preparation for the Quiz. The three of them also showed a high level of responsibility throughout the challenge – they independently read through a wide selection of resources with minimal guidance from the teachers.

# SIP Xinggang School and Changshu Foreign Language Middle School Student Exchange Programme

CVSS welcomed and hosted 50 students and 7 teachers from SIP Xinggang School and Changshu Foreign Language Middle School from the 15th to 16th of July 2015. Our North Stars were immensely excited by this visit and showed great enthusiasm in extending their hospitality to their guests.

It was a fruitful experience for all involved. Our North Stars hosted our guests with much graciousness as they brought them on a tour around the school and invited them to join in lessons as well. Throughout the two days, our North Stars mingled and bonded well with their buddies, forging strong friendships along the way.

To allow guests to have an idea of how learning takes place in CVSS, Mr Ryan Wong, Mr Wong Jee Heng, Mdm Geraldine Lim and Mdm Amy Tso conducted special Food & Consumer Education and Design & Technology lessons which allowed our visitors to experience enriching and memorable hands-on learning activities.

The brief stay provided our Chinese guests with an eye-opening experience as they were able to have a better understanding of Singapore and its education system. Through interaction, North Stars were able to broadening their horizons through learning more about a culture different from their own. All in all, the hosting programme was a success, functioning as an effective platform to strengthen ties between CVSS and the two schools.

# Lam Soon CC Competition
During the June holidays, CVSS sent in a team of two F&N students, Aloysius Chen Hong Jun and Brendan Tan of Sec 3B, to the Lam Soon CC SG50 Let's Bread and Roll Competition 2015. We are pleased to announce that the CVSS team emerged as champion of the upper secondary category.

This year, the competition is themed “SG50” and participating teams have to prepare and serve a creative dish SG50 incorporating designated products as main ingredients within 45 minutes. Wanting to bring out the heritage of traditional snacks, our team worked resiliently to create two original “kuihs” using designated bread, wrap, canned tuna and corn kernels.  At the competition, the team executed their plan confidently and was the first to complete and serve their dish. Through it all, they portrayed themselves as world-ready youths.

The C&T department would like to thank our school leaders for the opportunity to participate in this competition, as well as the parents of the team for their support.
