# National Environment and Water Quiz

Three Secondary 2 students emerged 3rd in place for the team category (for non-IP schools) of the annual National Environment and Water Quiz 2015.  The objective of the Quiz is to create awareness in our students – to inform them of their responsibilities in protecting and caring for the environment as well as in keeping it clean and green. 

This is the first time that CVSS has won a team prize in the Quiz that is organised by Nan Hua High School with the support of the National Environment Agency and Tetra Pak South East Asia Pte Ltd. Our team triumphed over 47 other non-IP secondary schools.

CVSS was represented by three talented North Stars – Vidhi Mahajan from Sec 2H, as well as Cheong Huan Feng and Darryl Chow from Sec 2E. Vidhi also emerged as the 9th top scorer in the Individual category, beating more than 120 students.

Vidhi, Huan Feng and Darryl demonstrated resilience in their preparation for the Quiz. The three of them also showed a high level of responsibility throughout the challenge – they independently read through a wide selection of resources with minimal guidance from the teachers.
