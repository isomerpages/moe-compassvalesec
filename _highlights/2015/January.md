# SG50 T-Shirt Design Competition

Compassvale Secondary School is pleased to announce that two of our students from Sec 4B, Lim Jia Hui and Lim Li Wen, have been awarded the first prize in the SG50 T-Shirt Design Competition organised by ITE College Central.  
  
The aim of this competition is to promote the awareness among secondary school students of how Singapore's 50 years of Nation Building was first engineered through years of industrialisation and manufacturing services.

Jia Hui and Li Wen used a 3D CAD (Computer-Aided Design) software, Solidworks, to create a design that is not only beautiful but also symbolically meaningful. During the semi-final on 15th January, they also impressed the judges with their fun-filled and thorough presentation.  
  
We are heartened and proud to see our students displaying creative and critical thinking skills in their work.
