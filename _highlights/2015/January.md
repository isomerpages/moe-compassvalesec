# SG50 T-Shirt Design Competition

Compassvale Secondary School is pleased to announce that two of our students from Sec 4B, Lim Jia Hui and Lim Li Wen, have been awarded the first prize in the SG50 T-Shirt Design Competition organised by ITE College Central.  
  
The aim of this competition is to promote the awareness among secondary school students of how Singapore's 50 years of Nation Building was first engineered through years of industrialisation and manufacturing services.

Jia Hui and Li Wen used a 3D CAD (Computer-Aided Design) software, Solidworks, to create a design that is not only beautiful but also symbolically meaningful. During the semi-final on 15th January, they also impressed the judges with their fun-filled and thorough presentation.  
  
We are heartened and proud to see our students displaying creative and critical thinking skills in their work.

# Achievements in the 2014 GCE O-Level Examinations

The CVSS family celebrates double happiness with the results of our graduating students of 2014. Following the success of our students at the GCE N-Level Examinations in 2014, the Sec 4(Express) and Sec 5N(A) North Stars have performed well in the 2014 GCE O-Level Examinations.

Jolene Ong, Phua Jian Teck and Janice Tan are among the top performing students from the Express stream. Besides excelling in the academic arena, they also exemplify traits of well-rounded individuals.

Jolene was the vice-president of the Student Council Board who has displayed strong leadership. She was also appointed Chairperson of Choir in 2013 for her commitment to the co-curricular activity (CCA). With great teamwork and devotion to honing her skills, she led her team to achieve Certificate of Distinction in the SYF competition in 2013. She is an Edusave Character Award holder as well as a recipient of the Edusave Awards for Achievement, Good Leadership and Service (EAGLES) (Leadership) in 2013. Jolene’s commitment to her studies sees her achieving eight distinctions in the GCE O-Level Examinations.

Jian Teck was a member of the Student Council Board and the chairperson of the school’s Youth Flying Club. With his strong leadership qualities, he was awarded the EAGLES (Leadership) in 2013. His ability to balance his studies and CCA well has helped him achieve seven distinctions.

Janice Tan was an executive committee member of the Student Council Board and the captain of the Netball team. She is also an EAGLES (Leadership) award holder. Janice is a compassionate student who participated actively in the school’s Values in Action programmes. With determination, hard work and commitment to her studies and CCA, she has performed well with five distinctions.

Our Sec 5N(A) students have also brought glory to the school with impressive results. Chong Ying Min achieved four distinctions in the GCE O-Level Examinations. In the area of leadership, she was a warrant officer in Red Cross Youth.

Well done, North Stars! You have, once again, risen to the occasion to achieve your success and make the school proud of you. We hope that our North Stars will scale to greater heights as they enter a new phase of learning and growing. May all of you always be World Ready Youths!
