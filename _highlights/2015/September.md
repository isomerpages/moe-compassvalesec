# Our School is a “Bright Spot”!

CVSS is pleased to share that we have been selected as a “Bright Spot” by the Public Hygiene Council (PHC) and MOE CCE under the Keep Singapore Clean Movement.

“Bright Spots” are shared spaces adopted by stakeholders who take active ownership of its cleanliness and help to educate and encourage good cleanliness practices.

Our school has been featured on “Bright Spots Around Singapore”, an interactive map showing various “Bright Spot” locations. Please click on the following link to find out more about our whole school’s effort in keeping our school’s environment clean and conducive for learning.
