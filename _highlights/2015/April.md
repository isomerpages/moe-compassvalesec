# 15th Anniversary & Awards Day
On 24th April, our school held her 15th Anniversary and Awards Day with the theme: Inspiring Pioneers, Igniting Passion and Illuminating Pathways. Ong Wan Qi Jolene, Vice Head of Student Council Board 2014 and Chairperson of Choir was presented the prestigious Outstanding North Star Award. The 2014 cohort contributed a wall painting for the North Star Room that has been recently refreshed. The wall painting is a symbolic reminiscence of the North Star.

 Some highlights of the evening are the opening of the North Star Room and the launch of the 15th Anniversary Commemorative Publication. As part of our celebration, a musical and an exhibition were put up to trace our heritage. The live performances during the dinner reception showcased the performing arts talent of the North Stars.

The CVSS family received praises and accolades in recognition of the achievements and hard work invested to bring the school to greater heights.

Happy 15th anniversary, Compassvale Secondary School!
