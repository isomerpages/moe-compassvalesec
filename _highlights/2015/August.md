# Punggol Central PAYM Love Red SG50 National Day Observance Ceremony

123 North Stars participated in the Punggol Central PAYM Love Red SG50 National Day Observance Ceremony on 9 August 2015.

56 of our cadets from NPCC, NCC, Boys Brigade, Girl Guides and Red Cross Youth collaborated with Seng Kang Secondary School’s uniform groups to form the Guard-of-Honour Contingent. The Parade Commander for the ceremony was SSGT Danishraziq b Abdul Rahman, our very own North Star NPCC from Sec 3C.

Our school’s NCC cadets also performed a freestyle drill entitled “Unity as One”, which showcased the creativity of our NCC(Air) Cadets perfected with much discipline and teamwork. This challenging performance required strong collaboration among performers as it incorporated music, hand movements and foot drills. In line with the 50th year of our nation’s birth, the spirit of this performance highlighted the importance of being a team player and how the building of our nation was not merely the work of one but every citizen of Singapore. 

Our dance team performed a dance item entitled “Remembrance of The Past”. This dance piece showcased the gracefulness and lithe footwork of our young and passionate CVSS dancers. The music and dance steps flowed together seamlessly to portray the emotions faced by one arising from a crisis. In line with the 50th year of our nation’s birth, the spirit of this dance paid tribute to the struggles that we have witnessed in the past and the hard work and resilience shown by our pioneers, forging a nation of people who can face the challenges and uncertainty of our future.

Towards the end of the ceremony, our choir team sang 5 National Day Parade Songs as well as the Courtesy Campaign Song “Make Courtesy Our Way of Life”. They were accompanied by the live band from Punggol Central CAC. It was heart-warming to see our students singing and waving enthusiastically during the medley.

The students were supported by their parents, CCA teachers, alumni members and their school mates. The students even had the opportunity to interact with the Guest-of-honour, Mr Teo Ser Luck after the event. Our school would like to take this opportunity to thank the organising committee of Punggol Central PAYM Loves Red SG50 National Day Observance Ceremony for the opportunity to be part of this meaningful celebration as we celebrate Singapore's 50th year of independence, our Golden Jubilee year. Happy 50th Birthday Singapore!
