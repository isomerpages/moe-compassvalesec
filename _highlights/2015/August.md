# Punggol Central PAYM Love Red SG50 National Day Observance Ceremony

123 North Stars participated in the Punggol Central PAYM Love Red SG50 National Day Observance Ceremony on 9 August 2015.

56 of our cadets from NPCC, NCC, Boys Brigade, Girl Guides and Red Cross Youth collaborated with Seng Kang Secondary School’s uniform groups to form the Guard-of-Honour Contingent. The Parade Commander for the ceremony was SSGT Danishraziq b Abdul Rahman, our very own North Star NPCC from Sec 3C.

Our school’s NCC cadets also performed a freestyle drill entitled “Unity as One”, which showcased the creativity of our NCC(Air) Cadets perfected with much discipline and teamwork. This challenging performance required strong collaboration among performers as it incorporated music, hand movements and foot drills. In line with the 50th year of our nation’s birth, the spirit of this performance highlighted the importance of being a team player and how the building of our nation was not merely the work of one but every citizen of Singapore. 

Our dance team performed a dance item entitled “Remembrance of The Past”. This dance piece showcased the gracefulness and lithe footwork of our young and passionate CVSS dancers. The music and dance steps flowed together seamlessly to portray the emotions faced by one arising from a crisis. In line with the 50th year of our nation’s birth, the spirit of this dance paid tribute to the struggles that we have witnessed in the past and the hard work and resilience shown by our pioneers, forging a nation of people who can face the challenges and uncertainty of our future.

Towards the end of the ceremony, our choir team sang 5 National Day Parade Songs as well as the Courtesy Campaign Song “Make Courtesy Our Way of Life”. They were accompanied by the live band from Punggol Central CAC. It was heart-warming to see our students singing and waving enthusiastically during the medley.

The students were supported by their parents, CCA teachers, alumni members and their school mates. The students even had the opportunity to interact with the Guest-of-honour, Mr Teo Ser Luck after the event. Our school would like to take this opportunity to thank the organising committee of Punggol Central PAYM Loves Red SG50 National Day Observance Ceremony for the opportunity to be part of this meaningful celebration as we celebrate Singapore's 50th year of independence, our Golden Jubilee year. Happy 50th Birthday Singapore!

# "Harmony in Our Hands" @ Sengkang Community Library

In commemoration of Racial Harmony Day on 21 July, our students from the MRL club as well as our CCE student ambassadors conducted games of the past for the visitors of Sengkang Community Library. These games included capteh, pick-up sticks, hopscotch and five stones. Our students took the opportunity to share the heritage and cultural value of these games as they instructed the young participants in the games. It was certainly an enriching and engaging session for all as Singapore’s rich diversity was celebratred through fun and exciting activities in alignment with this year’s Racial Harmony theme “Harmony in our Hands”.

The feedback from the visitors has also been positive.

One visitor wrote: ‘Glad that my children can join in this activity where they learn about some of the traditional games. Children of this generation hardly come into contact with simple games that require human interaction. They are usually on their tablets, where little cooperation is needed. It is interesting to note that many of the students may not know how the games are played, yet they do their best to read the instructions and patiently explain to the kids about how the games are conducted. Appreciate the effort.’

Another visitor wrote: ‘I like this activity organised by the students... I never knew that kuti kutis are for play. I thought it to be very small toys. I am happy to see my kids learning traditional games. The students were very helpful and friendly.’

# SG50 Reflections: Our Hopes & Memories
The SG50 HOME e-book is a birthday gift from all students to Singapore, in return for the SG50 ‘Building My SG’ Lego set that was given to them.

It is the collective effort of students from all primary and secondary schools, junior colleges/centralised institute, special education schools as well as the Singapore International School (Hong Kong). Students have put in a lot of effort for this project and have spent considerable amount of time doing research. This project has also allowed students to connect with the pioneer generation and gain appreciation for their contributions and sacrifices.  It also inspires students to create a better future for themselves and for Singapore.

To chronicle the changing faces of the seventh housing town built by the Housing and Development Board, a team of North Stars (Afraa Aijaz, Tan Jun Long, Kian Zhang Yu, Goh Geok Ling, Tan Choon Siang and Eileen Lee), accompanied by their teachers (Mrs Lee Sear Yeen, Mr Tan Wen Chuan, Mr Aloysius Chua Xun Fan, Mr Clement See Wei Liang, Mdm Donna Chang Sin Yi, Mr Ng Hong Pin and Mr Nicolas D Sangil III), embarked on a journey around the Ang Mo Kio Town estate through time. The story of the development of the town in 1975-1984 unfolds through a video presentation that gives the audience a glimpse of the lives of the residents, as well as their memories and aspirations for the future. It is complemented with photographs and written sources that capture the sights and sounds of life in the heartland. Essentially, this multimodal approach aims to connect the residents with other Singaporeans using personal and community stories.

One of the highlights of their project is Block 259 of Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1, an iconic block of circular flats that when seen from above, forms the shape of a clover. Over the years, the residents in the block are known across the island for their strong sense of belonging and kampung spirit as they have been living next to one another for years. The interconnectedness of the residents of the “Four Leaf Clover Block”, as it is affectionately known, has shown that public housing in Singapore goes beyond providing a roof for the owners. The sense of attachment to a home helps the dwellers forge a Singapore identity and a strong sense of rootedness to the country.

Entitled “Completion of Ang Mo Kio New Town in 1980”, this e-book can be viewed at [http://www.sg50home.sg/completion-of-amk-new-town-in-1980.html](http://www.sg50home.sg/completion-of-amk-new-town-in-1980.html) or through the SG50 HOME App which can be downloaded from Google Play or the App Store.

# 9th Interschool Theatresports Competition

Our North Stars have done us proud by clinching the First Position and the Most Popular Team Award in the recent 9th Interschool Theatresports Competition. Despite facing intense competition from other teams, our students remained resilient and demonstrated much creativity in their performance.

Theatresports is improvisational theatre done in a competitive way for dramatic effects. Organised by Dunman High School, competing teams perform scenes based on suggestions from the audience before being rated by a panel of judges. The competition tests not only the students’ reaction and ability to think and improvise on the spot, but also their teamwork and ability to co-operate collaboratively.  

The students involved in the competition are:

1.  Li Xin Jie   2F
2.  Kho Jia Hui   2F
3.  Chia Chiong Lun   2F
4.  Tan Jia Peng   2G
5.  Cheung Yuen Ling   3E
6.  Demi Chumponrong   4B
7.  Zhou Kevin Wu   4H

Well done North Stars!
