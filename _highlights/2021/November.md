# North Star Sparkle 2021
**STUDENT-INITIATED LEARNING - NORTH STARS SPARKLE PROGRAMME**

As a MOE new initiative, our school started Blended Learning (BL) in 2021 Semester 2 and Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) is a key feature in the regular Home-Based Learning (HBL) days.  The SIL aims to ignite the joy of learning in students and develop them into lifelong learners who are self-directed and passionate in their learning.  We have named our SIL “North Stars Sparkle Programme” in which **_SPARKLE_** stands for _‘**Seek PAssion, Refresh Knowledge, Learn and Explore**’_
