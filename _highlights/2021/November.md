# North Star Sparkle 2021
**STUDENT-INITIATED LEARNING - NORTH STARS SPARKLE PROGRAMME**

As a MOE new initiative, our school started Blended Learning (BL) in 2021 Semester 2 and Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) is a key feature in the regular Home-Based Learning (HBL) days.  The SIL aims to ignite the joy of learning in students and develop them into lifelong learners who are self-directed and passionate in their learning.  We have named our SIL “North Stars Sparkle Programme” in which **_SPARKLE_** stands for _‘**Seek PAssion, Refresh Knowledge, Learn and Explore**’_

An hour was set aside during the HBL days for students to carry out their SIL activity. Students were encouraged to decide what they wish to learn and plan for their choices of activities. Our North Stars certainly have many varied interests which include foreign languages, culinary arts, performing arts, sports and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) such as drone flying and coding. For students who were undecided on their choices, they had the option of choosing from a wide variety of school-curated modules designed by the school.

The programme culminated in the North Stars Sparkle Showcase on the last day of school to celebrate students learning. 125 North Stars across Secondary 1 to 3 classes presented their learning and artefacts with great aplomb. The presenters delighted their peers with dance and musical performances, mini demonstrations and interesting anecdotes highlighting the sweet spots and challenges they faced in their SIL journey.

**Seek Passion** -  The learning of foreign languages is a popular choice among our students. They were interested to learn languages such as Korean and Japanese. In their showcase, some students even conducted practical sessions to teach their peers how to speak simple words in the language that they have learnt. Coding is another popular choice among the students. Jovan Wee ventured into coding and shared about his sense of accomplishment whenever his code worked, his frustrations when his code failed, and how he finally rectified an error by researching for solutions online over a long time through sheer grit and determination.

**Refresh Knowledge** - Many of our students are also interested in playing musical instruments such as the violin, guitar and piano. Ethan James Poh has always been interested in playing the guitar but lost the drive to learn the instrument over time. The SIL sessions allowed him to set aside time to rekindle his interest and stay motivated.

**Learn and Explore** - As a food lover, Ooi Jun Jia pursued his interest in cooking. The dining restrictions due to COVID-19 safe management measures had led to fewer opportunities for him and his family to dine out. As such, he used the SIL sessions as opportunities to hone his culinary skills.

The showcase revealed the many talents of our North Stars as well as their grit in pursuing their passion and persevering despite many challenges faced.  The North Star Sparkle programme for the year concluded with the presentation of specially designed tokens of appreciation to the presenters. The students had learnt much from the programme and expressed that they look forward to another year of self-exploration and learning in 2022.

# Elementz and Youth Science Fortnight 2021

  

### Singapore Youth Science Fair 2021 and 19th Elementz Science Competition 2021

Our school has again done well in the annual **Singapore Youth Science Fair 2021** co-organized by Science Teachers’ Association of Singapore and the Science Centre Board. Held in August 2021, the fair aims to promote science education in Singapore.

There were a total of 58 projects submitted for the lower secondary category. Our students did a research project in which they carried out literature research and a series of experiments. They then presented their findings and analyses through a virtual poster that was submitted to the organisers for judging.

Despite the many restrictions due to Covid-19, our teams did their best and managed to clinch an **Accomplishment and Commendation award**!

Our two teams also submitted their research projects and virtual posters for the annual **19th Elementz Science Competition** organized by Anderson Secondary School earlier in July 2021. This competition aims to generate interest in scientific study through participation in investigative-type projects.

A total of 35 projects were submitted in the lower secondary category.  Our teams achieved a **Gold** and a **Silver** **award**! In addition, our Gold award team was the only team in the lower secondary category that was invited to share about their project via a pre-recorded presentation.
