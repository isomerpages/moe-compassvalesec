# Silver Medals in NUS Geography Challenge 2021

The NUS (National University of Singapore) Geography Challenge is an annual Geography competition jointly organised by the NUS Department of Geography and the NUS Geographical Society, with support from MOE. It aims to ignite the passion of secondary school students for the subject of Geography and inspire them to develop a heightened geographical perspective of the world around them. The theme for this year’s challenge was ‘_Passport to the World: Sustainable Footprints_’, which invited students to critically analyse possible courses of sustainable actions that humankind can adopt to tackle wicked problems like climate change, economic inequalities and food insecurity.  
  

A total of 115 teams and 460 students from secondary schools participated in the competition this year. Our school sent a team comprising Louka Tan Vaissiere Jun-Cheng (4E2), Josiah Khoo Jia Ying (4E2), Muhammad Huzair Bin Rahim (4E4), and Kegan Tay Yi Jie (4E4), who were all selected from our batch of Full Geography students. The students were involved in two rounds of the competition – an individual component which assessed students on Geography topics curated from the International Geography Olympiad syllabus, and a team component where students had to work together to complete a series of application questions.  
  

The team trained hard for this competition. They underwent an intensive developmental programme which exposed them to the different branches of Geography. Besides learning beyond the scope of their syllabus, the students were responsible for researching and presenting a new geographical concept learnt in their weekly trainings, such as concentric zone model and urban heat island effect – just to name a few.  
  

The students’ efforts paid off as the team did well, with two members of the team, Josiah Khoo Jia Ying and Muhammad Huzair Bin Rahim clinching the **Silver medal**. This places them within the **top 20% of all participants** in terms of performance, and represents a slight improvement from last year’s efforts (1 silver and 1 bronze).
