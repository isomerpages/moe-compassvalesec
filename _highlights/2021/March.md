# Silver Medals in NUS Geography Challenge 2021

The NUS (National University of Singapore) Geography Challenge is an annual Geography competition jointly organised by the NUS Department of Geography and the NUS Geographical Society, with support from MOE. It aims to ignite the passion of secondary school students for the subject of Geography and inspire them to develop a heightened geographical perspective of the world around them. The theme for this year’s challenge was ‘_Passport to the World: Sustainable Footprints_’, which invited students to critically analyse possible courses of sustainable actions that humankind can adopt to tackle wicked problems like climate change, economic inequalities and food insecurity.  
  

A total of 115 teams and 460 students from secondary schools participated in the competition this year. Our school sent a team comprising Louka Tan Vaissiere Jun-Cheng (4E2), Josiah Khoo Jia Ying (4E2), Muhammad Huzair Bin Rahim (4E4), and Kegan Tay Yi Jie (4E4), who were all selected from our batch of Full Geography students. The students were involved in two rounds of the competition – an individual component which assessed students on Geography topics curated from the International Geography Olympiad syllabus, and a team component where students had to work together to complete a series of application questions.  
  

The team trained hard for this competition. They underwent an intensive developmental programme which exposed them to the different branches of Geography. Besides learning beyond the scope of their syllabus, the students were responsible for researching and presenting a new geographical concept learnt in their weekly trainings, such as concentric zone model and urban heat island effect – just to name a few.  
  

The students’ efforts paid off as the team did well, with two members of the team, Josiah Khoo Jia Ying and Muhammad Huzair Bin Rahim clinching the **Silver medal**. This places them within the **top 20% of all participants** in terms of performance, and represents a slight improvement from last year’s efforts (1 silver and 1 bronze).

# Sec 4 & 5 STAR 1 Programme 2021

In the last week of Term 1/2021, the entire school and all our North Stars went through our signature STAR programme for student development: **S**eek Out Our Strengths; **T**ake Responsibility; **A**dopt an Enterprising Spirit; **R**eady For The World.  The programme comprises a series of varied and out-of-classroom experiences for each level to develop students’ character, social-emotional competencies and the 21st Century Competencies.  
  

Our Secondary 4 and 5 North Stars participated in a 3-day Ready For The World Programme aimed at equipping them with knowledge, life-skills and attitude to be ready for the world after graduation. The theme on the first day was ‘Discovering Who I Am’, where our North Stars took part in experiential learning activities and completed _DISC_ profiling tool to seek out their strengths and learning styles, develop their personal brands, learn interview skills and plan their portfolio to prepare for life after secondary school.  
  

‘Exploring My Education and Career Pathways’ was the theme for the second day where speakers and alumni from various post-secondary institutions and industries shared with our North Stars about the post-secondary course and career options. Sec 4NT students had the opportunity to visit Lifelong Learning Institute to experiment with converting their interests and passions into a form of life purpose. Sec 4NA students attended online workshops conducted by Temasek Polytechnic such as Animal Tangram Fun, Bubble Tea Journey and Cryptography and Malware.  Sec 4E5NA students had an engaging e-course advising with Nanyang Polytechnic lecturers to find out about the courses and career opportunities available to them.  
  

In addition, our North Stars learnt financial literacy skills through a L cube workshop by TP Smart. The L cube board game introduces the world of work to teach concepts such as economic literacy, income tax, investments, retirement funds and lifelong learning. Sec 4 students learnt how to make responsible, informed decisions through HPB Sexuality Education eTeens programme. Last but not least, Sec 5NA students participated in a Pathfinder workshop to chart their education journey and open up more possibilities and options.

All in all, our North Stars had many memorable and enriching experiential learning experiences during the entire STAR 1 programme, where many made personal discoveries and stepped out of their comfort zones to embrace new challenges. Over and above, these experiences will take them one step closer to finding their compass in life
