# 22nd International Elementz Fair 2021 and East Zone A\*STAR Science Fair 2021
  
#### BRONZE AWARDS IN ANDERSON SERANGOON JC INTERNATINOAL ELEMENTZ FAIR and MERIT AWARD IN VICTORIA JC EAST ZONE A\*STAR SCIENCE FAIR

Our school has again done well in the annual **22nd International Elementz Fair 2021** (formerly known as Science Research Conference and exhibition) organized by Anderson Serangoon Junior College. The fair aims to provide a platform for Upper Secondary and Junior college students to showcase their science research and prototypes which can contribute to the betterment of society.

A total of 46 schools participated with 143 project submissions, including 10 overseas institutions from Vietnam and Thailand. Out of the 92 teams participating in the Secondary School Category, our **two teams won a Bronze award each.**

In their research project, our students carried out literature research and a series of experiments, interviewed a scientist from A\*star in relation to their research, and presented their research findings to a panel of judges including a Q&A segment via Zoom.

Our two teams also submitted their research projects for the **East Zone A\*STAR Science Fair 2021** organized by Victoria Junior College. The fair aims to provide students the experience of conducting an investigative science project and provide students with a platform to share their findings and learn from others.  There were a total of 35 projects submitted for the Secondary school (Open) category, and our **Team 1 clinched a Merit award**.

Here are some photos of our students in action:
