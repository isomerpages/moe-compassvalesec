#### BRONZE AWARDS IN ANDERSON SERANGOON JC INTERNATINOAL ELEMENTZ FAIR and MERIT AWARD IN VICTORIA JC EAST ZONE A\*STAR SCIENCE FAIR

Our school has again done well in the annual **22nd International Elementz Fair 2021** (formerly known as Science Research Conference and exhibition) organized by Anderson Serangoon Junior College. The fair aims to provide a platform for Upper Secondary and Junior college students to showcase their science research and prototypes which can contribute to the betterment of society.

A total of 46 schools participated with 143 project submissions, including 10 overseas institutions from Vietnam and Thailand. Out of the 92 teams participating in the Secondary School Category, our **two teams won a Bronze award each.**

In their research project, our students carried out literature research and a series of experiments, interviewed a scientist from A\*star in relation to their research, and presented their research findings to a panel of judges including a Q&A segment via Zoom.

Our two teams also submitted their research projects for the **East Zone A*STAR Science Fair 2021** organized by Victoria Junior College. The fair aims to provide students the experience of conducting an investigative science project and provide students with a platform to share their findings and learn from others.  There were a total of 35 projects submitted for the Secondary school (Open) category, and our **Team 1 clinched a Merit award**.

Here are some photos of our students in action:

# NATIONAL SCHOOLS LITERATURE FESTIVAL 2021
  
On 10 July, a team of North Stars did the school proud at the **2021 National Schools Literature Festival (NSLF)** by clinching the **Gold Award for the Choral Speaking Competition (Virtual Format).** 

Organised annually by a committee of Literature teachers with support from NIE, CPDD and the National Arts Council, the NSLF provides a platform to enthuse and inspire students in the learning of Literature. Students from secondary schools across Singapore participated in the festival, competing in a range of activities to demonstrate their understanding and appreciation of literary texts such as poems, novels and plays. CVSS took part in three segments this year: Choral Speaking, Unseen Debate and Flash Fiction.

The **Choral Speaking segment** involves an ensemble using various voice combinations and contrasts to bring out the meaning and tonal beauty of a poem. This year, the virtual format required teams to pre-record their performance on video with each actor in a separate location**.** Our choral speaking team comprised the following Sec 1 students: Audrey Teng Yu Xuan (1E1), Syed Adil Bukhari (1E1), Rachmadi Cheryl Fernandez (1E1), Tan Liying Deenise (1E4), and Erika Sarah Netto (1N3).

The **Unseen Debate** **segment** entails teams from two schools engaging in a debate to compare two poems. This is the first time that CVSS has fielded a team for this event. The team comprised the following students from 4E2: Isabel Ng Cardoso, Kirsten Alessandra Romero, Ooi Le You, Sneha Menon and Wang Lek Jin Jolie.

The **Flash Fiction segment** requires the writing of a lively and entertaining piece of fiction, between 130-150 words, which can be read on the go.  Possible genres include fantasy, science fiction, dystopian literature and horror. Sofia Teo Xin Ni (3E1) wrote the entry representing CVSS this year.

 Although our teams for the unseen debate and flash fiction segments did not win any prizes, the teachers are proud of the students’ immense growth and learning in their journey of preparing for and participating in this year’s competition.  Their performance and entries will be showcased on the department noticeboard and during appropriate Literature lessons. All our student representatives certainly emerged from the experience feeling enriched, inspired and heartened that their hard work had borne fruit. Throughout the event, they also displayed a great amount of resilience, teamwork and sportsmanship. Their exemplary attitude and values indeed exemplify our North Star spirit.
