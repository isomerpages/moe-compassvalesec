# National Create Your Own Newspaper Competition 2020

Our students have been participating actively in the National Create Your Own Newspaper Competition over the years. The competition is jointly organised by the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning, SPH Chinese Student Paper Zbcomma and Xinmin Secondary School. In this competition, students played the role of a reporter to interview people from different walks of lives and subsequently wrote a newspaper report on their interviews. They also had to come up with an aesthetically pleasing design for the report, using Abode InDesign.

93 teams from 54 schools participated in the 2020 competition. Despite competing against students from SAP schools such as Nanyang Girls' High School, Dunman High School, Catholic High School, and Temasek Junior College, both our Upper Secondary and Lower Secondary teams did our school proud by clinching multiple awards.

Our Upper Secondary team clinched the **Gold Award (highest accolade in the competition) and In-depth Report Award**. The team interviewed Mr Chia Xun An, who shared about his struggles with depression and how he advocated for mental wellbeing. The team members were Alfred Lim Wei Xiang (3E6), Ling Yi Jun (3E5), Neo Kai Qi (3E6), Loh Ruo Yi (3E3), Lin Zihan (3E2).
