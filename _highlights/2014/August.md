# LEE KUAN YEW AWARD for ALL-ROUND EXCELLENCE
The Lee Kuan Yew Award, given at the end of secondary education, is meant to recognise well-rounded students who have excelled in both academic and non-academic spheres, and who exemplify the qualities articulated in our desired outcomes of education. This pinnacle award, given by the Ministry Of Education, reflects our educational objective of developing well-rounded students.

**Lee Kuan Yew Award for All-Round Excellence Recipient 2014**

We are pleased to announce that Teo Zhe Hao from our class of 2013 has been awarded the 2014 Lee Kuan Yew Award for All-Round Excellence!  

While at Compassvale Secondary School, Zhe Hao was an exemplary student who possessed the drive to excel in both his academic and non-academic endeavours. Not only did he achieve outstanding results in the GCE N-level Examinations, he was much-respected as a student leader of the Boys’ Brigade (BB) as well as the Student Council.

Zhe Hao is a self-directed learner who takes charge of his own learning and works proactively to improve his academic performance. He takes setbacks as lessons to be learnt and is never discouraged. His resilience and consistent efforts saw him being awarded the MOE Edusave Merit Bursary in 2010 and MOE Edusave Scholarship in 2011 and 2012. For demonstrating exemplary character and outstanding personal qualities through his behaviour and actions, Zhe Hao was given the MOE Edusave Character Award (ECHA).

As a Company Sergeant Major (CSM) for BB, he led his juniors by example. Committed to his Co-Curricular Activity (CCA), he volunteered and represented the school and BB in numerous competitions and events. Identified as the best cadet in his company, he was accorded the Best Boy Medal. He was also accredited with the BB Founders Award, the most prestigious award in the Seniors Programme in 2013. He is definitely one whom his juniors look up to.

As an Executive Committee member of the Student Council Board from 2012 to 2013, Zhe Hao demonstrated strong leadership qualities and carried out his duties with pride and eagerness. As a student councillor, he represented the school in a Service Learning and Leadership Training Trip to Laos in 2011. His contributions in the non-academic spheres were further affirmed in his attainment of the National Youth Achievement Award (NYAA) Silver Medal in 2012 and the Edusave Award for Achievement, Good Leadership and Service (EAGLES) (Leadership) in 2012.

The school congratulates Zhe Hao on his great achievement!

We are confident that our North Stars will draw inspiration from Zhe Hao’s accomplishments and strive to develop themselves to realise the Star within.
