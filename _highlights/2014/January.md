# Achievements in the 2013 GCE ‘O’ Level Examination
Riding on the success of our Sec 4N(A) and Sec 4N(T) students in their GCE ‘N’ Level Examination in 2013, our 2013 batch of Sec 4(Exp) and Sec 5N(A) North Stars has done well in the 2013 GCE ‘O’ Level Examination.

Among the top performing students are Gui Ming Yi, Sylvia Phua and Germaine Ng. Besides excelling in the academic arena, they also exemplify traits of well-rounded individuals.

Ming Yi was the head of the Student Council Board and the captain of the school’s badminton team in 2012. He led the student councillors in organising many school activities, such as the Secondary One Bonding Camp, Open House and Graduation Night in 2012, and the Secondary One Registration in 2013. He also represented the school in many competitions.

Sylvia was the vice-chairperson of the Student Council Board. She was elected Vice-Chairperson of Red Cross and promoted to the rank of Warrant Officer. In the same year, she also represented the school in the Red Cross Annual Current Affairs Competition and won the District and National Championship.

Germaine was appointed to Girl Guides Patrol Leader in 2012. Germaine has a flair for writing and was appointed as a student editor for the school newsletter in 2012.

Three students from Sec 5N(A) have also received impressive results. Lim Kai Boon and Lee Yu Zhen scored 9 points, and Jillian Tan achieved 10 points.

A remarkable 99.5% of the Sec 4(Exp) students attained 3 or more ‘O’ Level subject passes, exceeding the national average of 98.1%. In addition, 96.0% of the Sec 4(Exp) cohort attained 5 or more subject passes. This surpasses the national average of 91.2%.

Our Sec 5N(A) students also have noteworthy achievements. 92.9% of them attained 3 or more ‘O’ Level subject passes, which exceeds the national average of 86.9%.

Notably, 97.9% of our Sec 4(Exp) students are eligible for Polytechnic, while 77.9% of our Sec 4(Exp) students are eligible for Junior College admission.

Once again, the staff and students at CVSS congratulate our graduating North Stars for their impressive achievements. We hope our North Stars will continue to attain greater heights in the next leg of their educational pursuit. May all of you always be World Ready Youths!
