# CVSS Infocomm Club (Videography) Merit Awardee

The CVSS Infocomm Club (Videography) is pleased to share the good news that our entry for the Schools Digital Media Award (SDMA) 2014 has won the Merit Award Video Category for Secondary and JC level. This year's competition attracted a total of more than 500 entries. Organised by MOE and Ngee Ann Polytechnic's School of Film and Media Studies, the annual competition aims to provide a platform for students to creatively tell their stories through visual media.

Competing under the overarching theme ‘Do You Know?’, our team’s 3 minute video blog, entitled [‘Motion: Action and Reaction](http://sdma.moe.edu.sg/cos/o.x&ptid=588&c=/sdma/sdma_gal&func=view&rid=3159)’, featured the quest of an inquisitive student as she uncovered the physical law that explains how a body should exert itself in order to move forward.

Our Merit Awardees:

* Geok Ling (2C)
* Tiffany (2D)
* Crystal (2C)
* Choon Siang (2I)
* Cher Leong (2I)

Kudos to our team of North Stars!
