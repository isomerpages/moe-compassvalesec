# Green Moral Character Programme

On 28 May 2014, our Secondary Two North Stars served the Sengkang community by collecting recyclable goods from the residents in the vicinity of the school. The nine Secondary Two classes collected items such as magazines, books, newspapers and clothes from over 50 blocks, for recycling.

Two days prior to the collection, the students had gone to these blocks to spread the message of anti-littering, as well as, to inform the residents about the recyclable goods collection. Each class had the opportunity to design their very own posters and pamphlets and use their designs in spreading the message for this environmental cause.

In addition to these, the students were engaged in a talk by a speaker from the National Environment Agency (NEA). They learned more about dengue fever awareness on top of anti-littering and had passed these valuable information on to the residents during the collection. Truly, the talk by the NEA had been fruitful and enlightening, and had served to widen our North Starsâ€™ knowledge in the environmental cause, allowing them to speak with more conviction to the residents in Sengkang.

On the day of the recyclable items collection, the residents, in turn, responded overwhelmingly with their old newspapers and clothes.

Apart from involving the Sengkang community in this project, we also had three parents from our Parents Support Group who selflessly contributed their time and energy and helped the students in this collection.

Our North Stars demonstrated resilience and teamwork in carrying out this collection activity. Furthermore, they could empathise with the contractors as they had the opportunity to help out in the laborious task of transferring the goods from the blocks, to the trucks, and from the trucks to the containers.

The collection was a success, with the North Stars serving the community, learning much from this invaluable experience, and at the same time, contributing to an environmental cause.
