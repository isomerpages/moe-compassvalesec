# Overseas Service Learning Trip to Vientiane (Laos) 2014
On 29 October 2014, selected students from Compassvale Secondary School embarked on a service learning trip to Vientiane, Laos. This is an annual project where students with leadership qualities are selected to plan and execute a service learning project. This year, our North Stars rendered their help to Xang Khu Primary School by teaching the Laotian students English, Mathematics, Art and Craft, as well as fun games which were well-enjoyed by all. The team of North Stars also helped out in physical activities, such as cementing and carpentry, which helped to improve the infrastructure and facilities in the school.

Our North Stars also had the opportunity to try out local handicrafts such as weaving and tie-dyeing, as well as visit places such as the Victory Monument and COPE, an organisation with provides prosthetic and orthotic devices and rehabilitation for people affected by unexploded bombs that were dropped during the Vietnam War.

The North Stars demonstrated much resilience, graciousness and empathy by stepping out of the comfort zones to give their best in benefiting the Laotian community. As much as they have served the local community, our students have also learnt much from the locals and have learnt to appreciate what they have at home. Truly, they have gained many precious memories and experiences that they want to share with their fellow schoolmates upon their return.
