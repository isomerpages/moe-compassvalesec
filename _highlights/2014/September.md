# 8th Interschool Theatresports Competition
In the recent 8th Interschool Theatresports Competition organised by Dunman High School, our North Stars have done us proud by coming in first position! It is commendable that our students have shown resilience and creativity throughout the competition despite facing stiff competition from schools such as Nanyang Girls' High, Maris Stella High School, River Valley High School and Dunman High School. 

Theatresports is a form of improvisational theatre that is carried out in the form of a competition to achieve a dramatic effect. Opposing teams can perform scenes based on suggestions given by the audience. Thereafter, the audience and a panel of judge will rate the performances. This competition tests students’ abilities to think on the spot and boost their confidence to act in front of an audience.

Well done North Stars!

# News Flash: CVSS featured in Facebook Page of Mr. Heng Swee Keat, Minister of Education

As part of his Teachers' Day message, Mr. Heng Swee Keat shared through his Facebook page a photo essay by our very own art teacher, Mr. Tan Wen Chuan. Mr. Tan's photos capture the spirit of teaching and learning in Compassvale Secondary School. The dedication of the staff and the diligence of the North Stars have been artfully weaved into a story depicting the heart work of the teachers and support staff and the hard work put in by the students. Entitled "Glimpse", the album begins with a picture of the students getting ready for lessons in the morning, before leading the viewers into a one-day journey around the school. 

  

Excerpt from Mr. Heng's Facebook page: 

This Teachers’ Day, I would like to share with you a photo essay by Compassvale Secondary School’s art teacher Mr. Tan Wen Chuan. He took these photos to give a "Glimpse" into a school day. Through the eyes of a teacher, you will see that in an average school day, a child is supported by many people. And you will see that teachers support one another in their own growth and to do their best for their students.  
  
Through the snapshots of life in CVSS, Glimpse offers a intriguing view into the many facets of learning in Compassvale Secondary School. To enter the journey around CVSS, [click here](https://www.facebook.com/hengsweekeat/posts/759709174067610).
