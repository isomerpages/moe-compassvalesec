# 8th Interschool Theatresports Competition
In the recent 8th Interschool Theatresports Competition organised by Dunman High School, our North Stars have done us proud by coming in first position! It is commendable that our students have shown resilience and creativity throughout the competition despite facing stiff competition from schools such as Nanyang Girls' High, Maris Stella High School, River Valley High School and Dunman High School. 

Theatresports is a form of improvisational theatre that is carried out in the form of a competition to achieve a dramatic effect. Opposing teams can perform scenes based on suggestions given by the audience. Thereafter, the audience and a panel of judge will rate the performances. This competition tests students’ abilities to think on the spot and boost their confidence to act in front of an audience.

Well done North Stars!
