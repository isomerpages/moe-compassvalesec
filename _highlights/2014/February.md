# Inter School Robotics Challenge 2014
Our North Stars from the PA Robotics has done the school proud in The Inter School Robotics Challenge 2014! The North Stars who represented CVSS in the Line Tracing Category emerged champion. The other students who took part in three other categories also achieved spectacular results:

*   Creative Challenge Category: Best Report
*   Line Tracing Category: Merit Award
*   Obstacle Avoidance Category: 2 Merit Awards

This competition is an annual event organised by the School of Engineering of ITE College East. It promotes the use of creativity and problem solving skills among students through the use of IT and Robotics.

Although North Stars made their debut in the Creative Challenge Category, the team brought great honour to the school by achieving the Best Report Award. They impressed the judges with their comprehensive report and presentation on automated tableware cleaner.

Heartiest congratulation to our PA Robotics Team!
