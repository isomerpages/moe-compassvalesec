# Tourism Innovation Competition 2014
The Humanities Department sent two teams to participate in the Tourism Innovation Competition organised by Temasek Polytechnic. Our students did the school proud by clinching the Top Ten Award and a Certificate of Participation.

The theme of the competition was “Sustainability in the Hotel Sector”. Students were given one week to work on their concept proposal and display panels during the June holidays. This culminated in a presentation of their ideas to a panel of judges comprising academics and representatives from the tourism industry.
