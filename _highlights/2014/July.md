# Tourism Innovation Competition 2014
The Humanities Department sent two teams to participate in the Tourism Innovation Competition organised by Temasek Polytechnic. Our students did the school proud by clinching the Top Ten Award and a Certificate of Participation.

The theme of the competition was “Sustainability in the Hotel Sector”. Students were given one week to work on their concept proposal and display panels during the June holidays. This culminated in a presentation of their ideas to a panel of judges comprising academics and representatives from the tourism industry.

# SYF Art Lab Exhibition 2014
On 4th July 2014, 14 lower secondary North Stars taught visitors at the SYF Art Lab event how to create figurines using wire. Held at Gardens by the Bay, the 3-hour workshop is part of an annual celebration of Singapore’s art by the SYF Committee. CVSS is one of the 20 schools shortlisted from 80 primary and secondary schools, which submitted over 150 proposals.

Preparations for the course started during the March holidays with the construction of the wire sculpture. Through teamwork, the students produced a total of 35 wire figurines and 10 additional wire accessories such as hats, earrings and bangles. Each student customised his/her wire figurines according to his/her preferred styles of twisting and twining. They underwent two role-play sessions to ensure that they are able to speak confidently as they conduct the course. They also displayed a scrapbook during the event to show the process involved in making the wire figurines and relate their personal reflections.

# SIP Xinggang School Student Exchange Programme
CVSS welcomed a team of 40 students and four teachers from SIP Xinggang School from 10 to 11 Jul 2014. North Stars were greatly excited by the visit as they extended their hospitality to their buddies.

It was a fruitful and interesting experience for all the students. North Stars hosted the guests with much graciousness as they brought the Chinese students on a tour around the school and invited them to their lessons. To let the students have a glimpse of how learning takes place, Mr Patrick Ho and Mr Azlan conducted a special Design & Technology lesson in which Xinggang students got a hands-on learning experience. Although the stay was brief, the North Stars mingled well with their buddies, forging strong friendships and creating memorable experiences.

The exchange programme was a success as North Stars interacted and learned about different culture and its people. The Chinese guests also gained a better understanding of Singapore and got an eye-opener into Singapore’s education system. This exchange programme not only broadened the horizon of both groups of students, but also strengthened the tie between the two schools.
