CVSS celebrates with our Secondary 4N (Academic) and NT students on their achievements in the GCE N-Level Examinations!

Rui Xian and Yi Lin are active members of Environment Club. Yi Lin is the Chairperson of the Environment Club, and Rui Xian is the Vice-Chairperson. They commit themselves wholeheartedly to run programmes in the club and lead their peers. Their passion to lead life to the fullest motivates them to fulfil tasks with a spirit of excellence. The school’s emphasis on a holistic education has also shaped their attitude to do their best in all aspects of their learning.

Afiqah Syazana, Staff Sergeant and Vice-Chairman of CVSS’s National Police Cadet Corps, is also another Secondary 4N (Academic) student who has performed well.
  
Kelly Chak Mun Yi and Aida Nursyazana from Secondary 4NT have performed well in their examinations.
