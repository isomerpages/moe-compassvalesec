# 13th Anniversary and Awards Day held on 26 April 2013

On the evening of 26 April 2013 (Friday), CVSS celebrated our 13th Anniversary and Awards Day (A&A Day) with the School Advisory Committee members, staff, students and graduands of 2012 and their parents. Many who were present at the event would unanimously agree that the star of the evening were the students. The theme for the celebration was _Realising the Star Within_ which speaks about how our school has helped the students who passed through our gates to realise their true potential.

Through the various segments of the evening’s celebration (e.g. prize presentation, concert exhibition, live-performances) our stakeholders could see for themselves how the school has developed our students holistically in the 6 domains of Cognitive, Aesthetics, Physical, Social & Moral, Student Leadership and Student Morale under our holistic North Star Education Programme. Our stake-holders were impressed with not just the school’s achievements, but the exemplary behaviour of our students. Many commented that our North Stars are confident, talented and articulate. Our students are a living testimony of the success of our holistic North Star Education Programme.

The A&A day was also a day when the graduands of 2012 showed their gratitude and appreciation towards the school. This could be summed up clearly in a verse taken from the poem composed and presented to the school by Amirah of 4H (2012):

_“A place I miss <br>
A shelter, a second home <br>
A sky of opportunities  <br>
Where so many stars have shone”_

As we bring our 13th A&A celebration to a close, the school wishes to thank all parents and stakeholders for their unwavering support and partnerships in helping our students to realise the star within.
