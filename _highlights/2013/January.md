# Celebrating the Achievements of our North Stars

This January, CVSS celebrates the achievements of our North Stars in the 2012 GCE ‘O’ Level Examinations. We are immensely proud to commend our Top Achievers from the 2012 cohort, for  they are an outstanding lot not just in terms of what they managed to accomplish academically, but for their achievements and contributions in many other significant areas of school life too.  
  
Many of our Top Achievers were highly active members of the student community, often prominent Student Leaders – whether in the Student Council Board or in their respective CCAs. It is particularly noteworthy that the Executive Committee members of our 2012 Student Council Board, including both the Head and Vice-Head, were among our top scorers who scored 6 or 7 Distinctions. Other Top Achievers comprise students who were leaders that excelled in the Uniformed Groups, Aesthetics and Sports CCAs as well.  
  
The school is truly honoured to have played a part in nurturing these North Stars and hopes that they may serve as an inspiration for future cohorts of North Stars to continue to develop ‘the star within’ themselves and strive for greater heights in all areas of school life
