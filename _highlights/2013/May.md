# NICHE Status for Integrated Curriculum Programme

Compassvale Secondary has received the **NICHE Status** **for Integrated Curriculum Programme** since April 2013.

This programme develops the critical and creative thinking skills of our lower secondary students through authentic learning experiences, crafted specifically, relative to their learning experiences. The authentic learning experiences include local and overseas learning journeys, enabling our students to become effective communicators and active contributors in their learning.

Through this Integrated Curriculum Programme, students will explicitly understand the interconnectedness of various subject disciplines and how it relates to solving real-life problems.  Igniting their passion for life-long learning, the programme develops in students the thirst and hunger to be critical in their evaluations and creative in their choices, engendering respectable aptitudes and attitudes that will constructively impact not only those in their homes but also others beyond.

In 2014, selected Secondary Three students will be involved in the Integrated Curriculum Programme. Plans are underway to stimulate, invigorate and enlighten the young minds to articulate their discerned knowledge via cogent actions.
