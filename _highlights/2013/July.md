# Annual Cross-Country Run 2013

This year, the school held its annual cross-country run on 6 July 2013 (Sat) at MacRitchie Reservoir Park. In addition to the school’s effort in promoting sporting spirit and healthy lifestyle, the event also provided an opportunity for students to enjoy and to appreciate the beauty of Nature Park. 

In June, the annual event was threatened for postponement by the haze from neighbouring country that affected the whole nation.  Fortunately, the sources of the haze are under control and the weather has improved after both countries’ environment ministers met up to resolve the issue.

The whole school participated in this event.  More than five hundred students registered for the 3.6 km competitive run.  The rest of the students, who took part as non-competitive participants, walk/ jog the same challenging route. Many staff, who signed up for the competitive running event, became good role-models to students and showed them that fitness can be maintained through a balanced active lifestyle even as busy working adults.  Some staff also brought their family members to join in the walk/ jog session.

The event started with the Principal flagging-off for the competitive student runners.  The school also invited members of Parents’ Support Group (PSG) and parents of lower secondary students to join their child/ wards in the walk/ jog.  This is to engage the stake-holders in promoting partnership with parents and parent-child bonding through school event.

At the end of the event, the school leaders (Principal and the three Vice-Principals) and the Chairperson of PSG presented prizes to all winners of respective levels.

All in all, our Northstars, parents and staff had a memorable day and we definitely look forward to similar events in the future.
