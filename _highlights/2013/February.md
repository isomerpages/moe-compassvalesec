# Emergency Preparedness Exercise:
CVSS has successfully completed a full-scale Emergency Exercise on 22 February 2013. Through this exercise, the staff and students gained valuable insights into the evacuation and safety procedures during a crisis. The exercise was a collaborative effort between our school, the Singapore Police Force, Singapore Civil Defence Force and the MOE's Security and Emergency Planning Office.

At 10.30 am, the sirens went off to signal the start of the exercise. What triggered the sirens was the series of "explosion" from one of the Food and Nutrition Labs. Students evacuated to the school field and teachers assumed their respective positions and roles. A scenario of casualties and traumatised students being attended to at the First Aid Post and Care Post made the exercise seem realistic. In the emergency preparedness exercise, teachers learnt how to evacuate students, rescue and manage casualties, care for traumatized students and teachers, manage anxious parents and respond to the media. From this exercise, we learnt that a mindset of constant vigilance and unwavering preparedness is vital during unexpected school emergencies.

The exercise culminated in the debriefing session for all staff and the NE presentation for students. We received a certificate for the successful completion of Exercise Rhinos from SEMPO . The Singapore Civil Defence Unit also presented the School with the Civil Defence Ready Schools Programme Certificate.

# A Chinese New Year to Remember @ CVSS
Chinese New Year at CVSS was a heartwarming affair this year. Guests from AWWA Family Centre joined staff and students for a hearty breakfast at the school canteen and were also invited to the CNY Celebrations Concert thereafter.  This year’s concert featured a skit performance by renowned local theatre company, the Theatre Practice, and items by our students and alumni in Wushu, Dance and Band, which all enjoyed thoroughly. One of the highlights of this year’s concert was a segment which involved members of staff. Singing a series of English and Mandarin love songs, 5 teachers who crooned their hearts out for the segment were greeted with rapturous cheers and applause. The event ended on a high note with the giving of oranges to staff and red packets to our esteemed guests from AWWA, who bade us farewell with bright smiles and warm hearts.

Happy Chinese New Year to all!
