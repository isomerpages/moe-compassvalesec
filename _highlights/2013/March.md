# Project Love Can 2013
On the 9th of March, Project Love Can was organised by CVSS Girl Guides together with Seng Kang CC to raise funds for the needy in Punggol Central. This initiative aimed to raise awareness about the community among students. It also allowed them to put their school values in action by practicing graciousness and empathy.  
  
Students from various CCAs took part in this CIP project. They collected old unwanted items such as old newspapers and unwanted electronic items from the residents in the neighbourhood. Our North Stars had to work collaboratively to bring the items to the collection points safely. They remained resilient in the hot weather and persevered on to ensure all items were collected from the residents.  Indeed their hard work paid off as this activity raised $1202.50 from the items collected, which will be given out to the needy residents via the Punggol Central Welfare Committee Fund.
  
Well done North Stars and continue to upholding the school values!
