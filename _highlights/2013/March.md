# Project Love Can 2013
On the 9th of March, Project Love Can was organised by CVSS Girl Guides together with Seng Kang CC to raise funds for the needy in Punggol Central. This initiative aimed to raise awareness about the community among students. It also allowed them to put their school values in action by practicing graciousness and empathy.  
  
Students from various CCAs took part in this CIP project. They collected old unwanted items such as old newspapers and unwanted electronic items from the residents in the neighbourhood. Our North Stars had to work collaboratively to bring the items to the collection points safely. They remained resilient in the hot weather and persevered on to ensure all items were collected from the residents.  Indeed their hard work paid off as this activity raised $1202.50 from the items collected, which will be given out to the needy residents via the Punggol Central Welfare Committee Fund.
  
Well done North Stars and continue to upholding the school values!

The Environment Club is pleased to share the news that the Singapore World Water Day 2013 celebration ended on a high note at Lorong Halus Wetland. The World Water Day is held annually as a means of focusing attention on the importance of freshwater and advocating for the sustainable management of water resources. On 16 March 2013, over 30 000 participants took part in a variety of activities across different reservoirs and waterways, doing their part to mark Singapore World Water Day.  

We are proud to have 41 student volunteers from the Environment Club and the various CCAs to represent our school as the Water Ambassadors at the Lorong Halus Wetland. The students, together with the teachers and three alumni members from the Environment Club, have put in tremendous efforts in preparing for the logistics for this event.   

The students have displayed the school values during their interactions with the GOH and the residents. The Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean has commended on the hard work and dedication exhibited by our students.

Excellent job, North Stars!
