The CVSS Boys’ Bridage Company is pleased to share the happy news that our BB teams have achieved the GOLD Honour Roll in the annual BB Character Quest 2013.  
  
The BB Character Quest is one of the 3 keynote BB competitions in Singapore which was held during the September school holiday on 14 September 2013.  
  
Our 3 teams of BB Boys (each team includes Sec 1,2 & 3 Boys) had played well against other established BB Companies from other schools such as Raffles Institution, Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) and Victoria School in the competition held in Victoria School. It was a full-day competition which comprises both knowledge and content-based test in the morning and a games cum telematch race in the afternoon.  
  
Our Boys had demonstrated our school values of Resilience & Integrity as they completed all the tasks for the whole day to the best of their abilities in their respective teams.
