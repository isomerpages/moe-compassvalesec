# 10th National PET Rocket Competition – Overall Champion in the PET Parachute Category

On 17 August 2013, a team of Sec 3 Science students represented the school to compete in the 10th National PET Rocket Competition. Thanks to their spirited performance, our school managed to emerge as the overall champion in the PET Parachute category based on accumulated scores.  
 
Over the years, our school has done consistently well in the competition. We achieved 4th position in 2010, 3rd position in 2011, and were the champions for PET Parachute in both 2012 and 2013.  

In the PET Parachute category, customised rockets made from PET bottles would be launched. As the parachute employs itself in mid-air, the score is calculated based on how close to 8 seconds it takes before the rocket touches down. In the course of making and launching the rockets, our North Stars displayed resilience and teamwork to sharpen their skills, and applied scientific concepts to improve the success rate.  

The pair of students from Sec 3F, Ang Yan Ang and Ong Zheng Jie, managed to come in as first runner-up in the Individual PET Parachute category. In addition, the other members also contributed collectively to come in 5th, 6th and 7th positions in the Individual category. They are:

* Wee Li Shuen - 3E
* Kok Li Wen - 3E
* Kwok Jian Hong Ernst - 3E
* Santiworakhun Atichat - 3E
* Javier Lim Kai Xiang - 3E
* Loy Qin Yu Prescelia - 3F
* Hoo Kah Jun - 3F
* Neo Jia Hao - 3F
* Quek Zheng Yi - 3F
* Tan Ka Shing - 3F
* Wang Hui Yang - 3F

# Toy Design competition 2013

On 31 July 2013, our school participated in the Toy Design competition 2013 organised by the Singapore Polytechnic. During the event, our North Stars had the opportunity to learn how to draw using two Computer Aided Design software, “Autodesk Inventor” and "123D Make". Through the software "123D Make", we made our winning design, which won us a Merit Award with a cash prize of S$150.

  
Congratulations to the following winning team members:  
  
* Peh Yong Sheng (4C)
* Syafiq B Rahim (4C)
* Ng Poh Hsien (4C)
* Muhammad Danial Alfian (4C)
  
All in all, it was an eye-opener for us as we were not only able to see the many innovative designs, but were also treated to tips shared by the organiser. The competition has definitely stretched our students' thinking and our students have also risen to the occasion by showing others that they are truly thinking innovators. Well done North Stars!
