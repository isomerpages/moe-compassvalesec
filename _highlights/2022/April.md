### CVSS STAR 1 PROGRAMME 2022

In the last week of Term 1, all students went through our signature, level-wide STAR programme for student development: **S**eek Out Our Strengths; **T**ake Responsibility; **A**dopt an Enterprising Spirit; **R**eady For The World. The programme comprises a series of varied experiences for each level to develop students’ character, social-emotional competencies and 21st Century Competencies.

**Sec 1** <br>
Sec 1s discovered their personal and inter-personal strengths by pursuing personal growth, sporting and aesthetic experiences. In two days of arts exposure and sports education, they learnt to design and create wearable art as well as try their hand at laser tag and combat archery. As part of positive education, students also went through a structured experience to achieve a growth mindset. They also learnt how to give compliments to others, which culminated in each class working together to put up a “positivity tree” in their classrooms to foster a positive classroom culture.

**Sec 2**<br>
Sec 2s went through a series of workshops to learn about taking responsibility in different areas of their lives. They learnt about being a responsible team member through cup-stacking games, and the importance of putting in time, effort and good communication to achieve team cohesion. They also learnt about the five practices of exemplary leadership from The Leadership Challenge, to be better leaders of self and others through various group activities. Learning how to take responsibility for the environment was the other key takeaway for the students. They learnt about carbon footprint, environmental waste and sustainable living through upcycling. Finally, they had a hand at Virtual Reality (VR) or Augmented Reality (AR) through various engaging activities, which piqued their interest to explore it further in their own time!

Sec 3 Express/NA students participated in 3-day Applied Learning Programme Modules (ApLM) focusing on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) in various Polytechnics or our school, while the Normal (Technical) students attended a 4-day Elective Module on My First Programmable Robot in ITE College East. The ApLM modules included Aerospace Fundamentals with Flight Simulation, Land Rover Challenge, Automotive Engineering, 3D Product Design, Being a Youtuber, Digital Marketing, Digital Game Development, Creative Media, Virtual Reality, Forensic Science, Food Innovation and Hospitality Business. The Sec 3 Express/NA students also attended a session on Mindfulness Appreciation, participated in Values-in-Action activity, and learnt from the author of a self-help book, Mr Gavin Seah, on ‘True Humility: Finding Peace and Balance in Today's Modern Society’, who shared about the challenges he faced in his formative years, and how he overcame them.

**Sec 4/5**<br>
Sec 4/5s went through our “Ready for the World” Programme, equipping them with knowledge, life-skills and attitude for life after graduation. The programme included DISC profiling on strengths and learning styles, and workshops on personal effectiveness and branding (which covers interview skills and portfolio planning), and financial literacy. The students also attended an ECG Seminar by speakers and alumni from various post-secondary institutions and industries. In addition, Sec 4E5N students attended an e-course advising by Nanyang Polytechnic, Sec 4NA students attended PFP (Polytechnic Foundation Programme) talk by Temasek Polytechnic, DPP (Direct Entry to Polytechnics Programme)/ITE EAE (Early Admission Exercise) talk by ITE College Central and a Pathfinder workshop by our school ECG counsellor, while Sec 4NT students visited Lifelong Learning Institute. The programme for the Sec 4s culminated with each class working together to put up a “SEC growth tree” in their classrooms, as they reflected on developing their social-emotional competency (SEC), while the Sec 5s participated in the Pathfinder workshop to chart their ECG journey.

All in all, our North Stars had many memorable and enriching experiential learning experiences during the entire STAR 1 programme, where many made personal discoveries and strengthened their bonds with their classmates. These experiences have certainly taken our North Stars one step closer to finding their compass in life and realising the STAR within!
