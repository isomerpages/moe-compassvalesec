### CVSS STAR 1 PROGRAMME 2022

In the last week of Term 1, all students went through our signature, level-wide STAR programme for student development: **S**eek Out Our Strengths; **T**ake Responsibility; **A**dopt an Enterprising Spirit; **R**eady For The World. The programme comprises a series of varied experiences for each level to develop students’ character, social-emotional competencies and 21st Century Competencies.

**Sec 1**  
Sec 1s discovered their personal and inter-personal strengths by pursuing personal growth, sporting and aesthetic experiences. In two days of arts exposure and sports education, they learnt to design and create wearable art as well as try their hand at laser tag and combat archery. As part of positive education, students also went through a structured experience to achieve a growth mindset. They also learnt how to give compliments to others, which culminated in each class working together to put up a “positivity tree” in their classrooms to foster a positive classroom culture.
