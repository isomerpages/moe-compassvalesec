# Achievements in the 2016 GCE O-Level Examinations

2017 began on an uplifting note for CVSS as our graduating cohort of 2016 came back to receive the results of the GCE O-Level examinations. Both the Sec 4 Express and Sec 5 Normal (Academic) course students achieved above national average results in percentage passes and percentage distinctions for almost all the subjects.  77 students - almost one third of all students, obtained 4 or more distinctions out of 6-7 subjects, with our top student achieving 8 distinctions, 9 students with 7 distinctions and 17 students with 6 distinctions.  82.7% of our Express students qualified for Junior College while 100% are eligible for the polytechnics.  The results are among the best, if not the best, in the school’s history.

Despite going through a leg surgery due to a major illness and long absence from school for hospitalisation and recovery, Kenrick Seah of 4E4 remained positive and overcame fears and physical difficulties to attain a commendable 4 distinctions. Yazimah Nehar Bte Mohamed of 4E1 had difficult family circumstances and her father was critically ill in the few months leading to the national exams.  Despite her worries and frequent hospital visits, she strove to do her best and managed to attain 3 distinctions (all A1s).

# Second Placing in Republic Poly Renesas Grand Prix Robotics Competition 2016
Our students took part in the RP Renesas Grand Prix Competition 2016 organised by Republic Polytechnic for the first time and clinched Second place in the competition!  This competition for secondary and tertiary students was held on 2 November at Republic Polytechnic.  Our students competed against more established teams from many schools including School of Science and Technology, Anderson Secondary School, Hillgrove Second, Woodlands Secondary, Bukit Merah Secondary and Peicai Secondary School etc and achieved unexpectedly good results.

In this competition, students must build and programme a microcontroller racing car which will then on a F1-style racing track. The racing track consists of many sharp turns, twisty sections and ramps. To complete the track and win the race, the car has to have good design and programming of speed. To prepare for this competition, our students attended a 3-day training workshop at Republic Polytechnic to build their cars and learn C-programming. They also spent several afternoons to test and fine-tune their racing cars at the track. Throughout the entire process, our students demonstrated critical and inventive thinking, resilience, strong teamwork and good sportsmanship as they faced the more established teams during the competition. All of these indeed exemplify the indomitable North Star spirit expected of all our students!
