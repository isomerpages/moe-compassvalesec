# Achievements in the 2016 GCE O-Level Examinations

2017 began on an uplifting note for CVSS as our graduating cohort of 2016 came back to receive the results of the GCE O-Level examinations. Both the Sec 4 Express and Sec 5 Normal (Academic) course students achieved above national average results in percentage passes and percentage distinctions for almost all the subjects.  77 students - almost one third of all students, obtained 4 or more distinctions out of 6-7 subjects, with our top student achieving 8 distinctions, 9 students with 7 distinctions and 17 students with 6 distinctions.  82.7% of our Express students qualified for Junior College while 100% are eligible for the polytechnics.  The results are among the best, if not the best, in the school’s history.
