# Achievements in 2017 GCE N-Level Examinations

The release of the 2017 GCE N-Level results was a momentous occasion for our cohort of 107 Normal course students. Students, parents and staff gathered in the school hall to collectively celebrate the commitment and excellence our students have demonstrated in both academic and non-academic pursuits.

On the whole, 4NA students have achieved above national performance in terms of both percentage passes and distinctions for most subjects, including Malay, Food and Nutrition, Science (Physics / Chemistry), Chinese, English and Science (Chemistry / Biology). 81.6% of our 4NA students are eligible for promotion to 5NA, which is above the national average of 76.6%, and 10.5% of our students are eligible for the Polytechnic Foundation Programme (PFP).
