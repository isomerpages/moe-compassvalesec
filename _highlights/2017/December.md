At the release of the results, the school also affirmed 5 students who have achieved commendable performance in spite of difficult circumstances. Despite poor health condition, Chan Tang Rui of 4N1 remained positive and qualified for the ITE Direct Entry Scheme to Polytechnic Programme (DPP). Toh Xun Wen of 4N2 struggled academically in primary school. However, he persevered in his learning and even encouraged peers around him to do their best.

A student who initially faced certain learning challenges, Low Yuan Yow of 4N2 showed tremendous improvement in self-management over the years and realised his goal of qualifying for DPP.  Filzah Bte Abdol Aziz of 4T1 overcame health problems and attained an ‘A’ for Elements of Business (EBS) and a pass in all subjects.  Being the eldest among 3 other siblings, Nurul Jannah Binte Roslan of 4T1 had to juggle between taking care of her younger siblings and her studies.
