# East Zone A*Star Science Fair 2017

The East Zone A\*Star \[Agency of Science, Technology and Research\] Science Fair is an annual science carnival organized by the East Zone Science and Technology Centre @ Victoria Junior College to nurture young research scientists where more than a thousand primary and secondary school students take part in many science-related activities.   
  
As part of the Science Fair, students also take part in a science research competition earlier and present their research findings to a panel of judges from various A\*STAR research institutes such as BTI, GIS, IMRE and IHPC.  In this competition, teams of 2-4 students had to conceptualize an investigative project involving the use of scientific inquiry. They had to perform experiments, collect data and design a poster to present their findings. A total of 89 teams comprising 292 students from 32 secondary schools took part in the competition this year, including top schools such as Dunman High School and Victoria School, and the winning entries were showcased at the carnival on 21 July 2017.  
  
**Our school took part in this competition for the first time and sent in two teams.  Despite our first attempt, both teams did us proud by clinching a Bronze award each in their respective categories!**  The competition was tough as there was only a total of 3 Gold, 7 Silver, 8 Bronze and 7 Merit Awards given out across 3 categories (Open, East Zone and Lower Secondary) in the competition.
