40 students from our four Performing Arts CCA groups (Band, Choir Dance and Drama) visited Hangzhou, Suzhou and Shanghai, China from 29 Oct to 5 Nov 2017 to enrich their appreciation and learning experience of performing arts, develop 21st century competencies of global awareness, cross-cultural skills and sensitivities, and sensitive themselves to the place of Singapore in the world and deepen their commitment and rootedness to Singapore.  
  
The students had ample opportunities to watch various world class arts performances which included the Song Dynasty City Musical performance at Song Dynasty City and the famous “Impression of West Lake” outdoor performance in Hangzhou. The students also tried their hands at a traditional Chinese paper fan-making workshop in a Fan Museum in Hangzhou and attended a half-day exchange programme with the Hangzhou Art School where they watched the dance students going through their paces and the drama students putting up their practical test in drama performance.  In Suzhou, the students was treated to a night of traditional Jiangnan cultural performances by experts in _Pingtan, Kunqu, Guqing and Dixiao_ in the idyllic Master-of-Net garden.  In Shanghai, the students had the rare opportunity to watch a fusion drama performance incorporating acrobatic acts by “Dislocate”, an acclaimed Australian drama troupe in the state of the art Shanghai International Dance Theatre.

# LOWER SECONDARY PROJECT WORK ON SUSTAINABLE LIVING 2017

Our school reintroduced the interdisciplinary Project Work for all lower secondary Express and Normal (Academic) students this year.  The Project Work curriculum aims to provide students with the opportunity to synthesise knowledge from various subject areas such as science and humanities and critically and creatively apply it to real life situations.   It also aims to develop in our students 21st Century Competencies and skills such as collaboration, research, communication and independent learning.  
  
The theme for the Project Work is “Sustainable Living” as part of the school’s environment education.  In Semester 1, Sec 1 students worked on topics such as ‘Management of Food Wastage’ and \`Effective Use of Recreation Spaces’. They visited the ENVision Gallery to learn about Singapore’s environment story through the interactive exhibits as they looked for innovative ways to advocate the reduction in food wastage in their communities. Some groups analysed how Singapore’s limited recreational spaces could be managed sustainably and cater to the diverse needs of the community.

In Semester 2, Sec 2 students took on the topics of ‘Biodiversity Conservation’ and \`Energy Sustainability’ as they looked at future challenges to sustainability. Some groups researched on how to promote environmental sustainability by designing informative biodiversity trails in their neighbourhoods. These students went through a trail in Hort Park to understand how to design a biodiversity trail. Other groups learnt about the use of solar energy in a workshop conducted by Temasek Polytechnic. They went on to design household devices which worked on renewable sources of energy. The projects were then showcased during the Post-Examination period at the Project Work Carnival.

# ARTS@KK WOMEN’S AND CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL 2017
Our school was invited by KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital this year to participate in Arts@KKH, a community outreach programme where performing arts groups perform for patients, visitors and staff at KKH. On 25 Oct 2017, 138 members from our four Performing Arts CCA Groups (Band, Choir, Dance & Drama) put up an enthralling display of songs, dance and a skit at KK Hospital. Their lively and energetic performances captivated the audience and warmed the hearts of patients and their caregivers.  
  
Besides contributing to a good cause, Arts@KKH is also a valuable platform for our North Stars to showcase their talents and allow members of the public to have a deeper appreciation of the various performing arts. To mark the partnership between us, KK Hospital presented a certificate and token of appreciation to CVSS at the end of the event. The event was also featured in KKH’s Facebook with 11 photos and the following caption: “It was an exceptional arts fiesta at the Arts@KKH by Compassvale Secondary School, where students from the school’s Band, Choir Group, Drama Club showcased their talents in FOUR dynamic performances!  A big thank you to Compassvale Secondary School and all the young performers for the lively and energetic performances!”
