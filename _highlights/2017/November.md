# PERFORMING ARTS CUM CULTURAL IMMERSION LEARNING JOURNEY TO CHINA SUZHOU/HANGZHOU/SHANGHAI 2017

40 students from our four Performing Arts CCA groups (Band, Choir Dance and Drama) visited Hangzhou, Suzhou and Shanghai, China from 29 Oct to 5 Nov 2017 to enrich their appreciation and learning experience of performing arts, develop 21st century competencies of global awareness, cross-cultural skills and sensitivities, and sensitive themselves to the place of Singapore in the world and deepen their commitment and rootedness to Singapore.  
  
The students had ample opportunities to watch various world class arts performances which included the Song Dynasty City Musical performance at Song Dynasty City and the famous “Impression of West Lake” outdoor performance in Hangzhou. The students also tried their hands at a traditional Chinese paper fan-making workshop in a Fan Museum in Hangzhou and attended a half-day exchange programme with the Hangzhou Art School where they watched the dance students going through their paces and the drama students putting up their practical test in drama performance.  In Suzhou, the students was treated to a night of traditional Jiangnan cultural performances by experts in _Pingtan, Kunqu, Guqing and Dixiao_ in the idyllic Master-of-Net garden.  In Shanghai, the students had the rare opportunity to watch a fusion drama performance incorporating acrobatic acts by “Dislocate”, an acclaimed Australian drama troupe in the state of the art Shanghai International Dance Theatre.
