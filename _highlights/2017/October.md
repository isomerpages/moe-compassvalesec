# 6TH NATIONAL CREATE YOUR OWN NEWSPAPER COMPETITION 2017

Our North Stars participated in the 6th National Create Your Own Newspaper Competition organised by The Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning, SPH Zbcomma and Xinmin Secondary School in July 2017.  Despite facing stiff competition from schools like Hwa Chong Institution, Nanyang Girls' High and CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School, our North stars have done us proud by clinching the **Silver Award and Best Layout Award in the Upper Secondary Category**, as well as the **Commendation Award in the Lower Secondary Category.**

Participants had first-hand experience at interviewing people and creating newspaper articles, learnt valuable skills and developed their passion for the Chinese Language.  Our upper secondary team reported on the growing trend of doodling in journals. The students interviewed teenagers on why they prefer hand drawn journal to the conventional journal and planner, as well as owners and shop assistants of journal shops.  The team comprised Jennifer Goh Mui Foong (4E4), Joachim Aw Man Ling (3E5), Lim Siang Yee (3E2) and Liow Lydia (3E5).

In doing so, they explored and reported on Chinese bookstores that have stood the test of time.  The team comprised Tan Jin Ying (1E5), Dai Lin Na Selena (1E5), Eng Jie Xuan (1E5) and Leow Lu Yu (1E5).

# SECONDARY 3 SERVICE LEARNING PROGRAMME 2017

As part of our school’s ‘Learning for Life Programme’ on Community & Youth Leadership – “Inspired North Stars Inspire Actions”, all Sec 3 students carry out self-initiated Values-in-Action projects to engage and meet the practical needs of the community in an authentic situation.  The programme empowers students to take ownership in the planning and implementation of various VIA projects to benefit the community.  
  
To ensure all students are equipped with the necessary knowledge and leadership skills, all of them attend a Service Learning workshop over 3 sessions, covering the stages of planning, preparation, execution and reflection, and understanding the importance of being a socially responsible citizen.  
  
This year, our students brought smiles to the residents at Sunlove Abode for the intellectually-infirmed, Bright Hill Evergreen Home for the Elderly, and for the first time, the Association for Persons with Special Needs (APSN) Centre for Adults at Kembangan-Chai Chee Community Hub.  The students engaged the residents and special needs friends through simple games such as bingo, collaborative art and craft projects.  They also helped the residents their daily routines, and accompanied the residents on outings to places such as the Peranakan Museum, Gardens by the Bay and the National Gallery of Singapore.

After carrying out the Service Learning projects, students reflected on the experiences gained and shared with their peers from across the level about their projects, learning points and key takeaways.

# GREEN COMPASS PROGRAMME 2017

As part of our school’s flagship environmental education programme – ‘Green Compass Programme’, all Sec 2 students were tasked to learn about upcycling and then apply what they learnt to create artefacts to enhance their classroom environment.  To prepare them for the task, all the students attended a series of talks and upcycling workshops conducted by the National Environment Agency (NEA) and the Singapore Environment Council (SEC).  At the workshops, students learnt how to use recyclable waste materials creatively and upcycle them for various uses, such as ornamental fairy gardens that utilise used cans, practical tote bags made from old t-shirts and recycled paper made from waste paper.  Each class had to come up with two upcycled artefacts which they deemed useful to their class or school environment.  Students got to see how each class created and made use of their artefacts. It was indeed a fruitful time of learning how to reduce the waste around us through innovation and put them to greater use. The students shared what they learnt with their school mates and presented their class’ upcycled artefacts in May.

Besides making a positive impact within CVSS, some of the students were also given opportunities to exhibit their upcycled artefacts and conduct paper recycling workshops for members of the public through outreach platforms such as ‘G!innovation’ and ‘Just One Earth Day’ co-organised by the North East CDC and NEA. By reaching out to the community, our green advocates hope to raise awareness on environmental issues and share their insights on green values and practices.

# NORTH EAST CDC COMMUNITY LEARNING JOURNEY 2017

Our school collaborated with the North East Community Development Council to facilitate a Community Learning Journey for our students as an extension of the NECDC’s Community Employment Programme (CEP) to provide students a better understanding of the various NECDC programmes available in the North East district, the social experience of involving in community work, and educate them on good citizenry and social responsibility.  
  
Student volunteers were matched to one CEP beneficiary to understand the NECDC community programme which the CEP beneficiary is working for, to learn about the job scope and to assist in their work.  Over the course of four weeks in July this year, 12 student volunteers from Badminton, Drama Club and Aeronautics Club helped out with the community services at Beacon Residents’ Committee and Workspace@Sengkang CC.  
  
At Beacon RC, our students helped man the community toy library and learnt how to do simple administration work such as tagging library items and managing the loan and return of board games and books. They also learnt about organisational skills and the importance of accountability.

At Workspace@Sengkang CC, our students helped digitise the signing in process and attend to users of the private meeting rooms and work stations.  They learnt about simple workflows and computer literacy skills.

Through this community learning journey, our students learnt how to interact with members of the public and had the opportunity to serve the residents in an authentic setting and contribute to the community meaningfully.

# INTERNATIONAL COASTAL CLEAN-UP SINGAPORE (ICCS) 2017
As part of our school’s commitment in advocating environmental sustainability, 120 students from various CCAs, teachers and parent volunteers took part in our annual participation of the International Coastal Clean-up Singapore (ICCS) in September 2017 at Changi Beach Site 3.  The effort was jointly organised by our school and Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum.  
  
ICCS is an international event which aims to collect data on the shoreline debris as well as encourage communities to come together to do their part in keeping their shorelines clean by removing the debris. The information gathered serves to educate the public on marine debris issues and to encourage positive change by submitting the data collated to governmental and international organisations that will reduce debris along the shorelines and enhance aquatic environments.  
  
Our Environment Club student leaders and members led the efforts by helping to organise the logistics for the event. They also took up roles during the actual ICCS such as collating the data and weighing the mass of the trash collected.  
  
Through this meaningful event, our school did our part to raise awareness on anti-littering and protection of our marine environment and our students learnt about the importance of keeping our shorelines clean.

# SENGKANG CENTRAL PAYM LOVES RED NATIONAL DAY OBSERVANCE CEREMONY 2017

As part of CVSS’s efforts to reach out to the community, 12 NCC (Air) cadets and 24 Band members took part in the annual Sengkang Central PAYM Loves Red National Day Observance Ceremony held at Sengkang Community Centre on 6 August 2017.  Mr Teo Ser Luck, Member of Parliament for Sengkang Central addressed the audience and later presented a plaque of appreciation to our school for our participation.

Our NCC cadets put up a combined Freestyle Drill and Precision Drill performance which requires a high level of coordination.  The training requires strong discipline, creativity, teamwork and trust among the squad members.  This signifies that despite our diversity in race, language and religion, we can still come together to play a part in nation building and foster unity as one people, in line with this year's NDP theme of ‘#OneNationTogether’.!

Our Concert Band serenaded the crowd with their melodious rendition of National Songs like ‘Home’ and ‘Stand Up for Singapore’. This capped off a joyful morning of celebrations, lifted everyone’s spirits and renewed the sense of belonging to Singapore for all present.
