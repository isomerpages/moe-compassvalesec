# 6TH NATIONAL CREATE YOUR OWN NEWSPAPER COMPETITION 2017

Our North Stars participated in the 6th National Create Your Own Newspaper Competition organised by The Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning, SPH Zbcomma and Xinmin Secondary School in July 2017.  Despite facing stiff competition from schools like Hwa Chong Institution, Nanyang Girls' High and CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School, our North stars have done us proud by clinching the **Silver Award and Best Layout Award in the Upper Secondary Category**, as well as the **Commendation Award in the Lower Secondary Category.**

Participants had first-hand experience at interviewing people and creating newspaper articles, learnt valuable skills and developed their passion for the Chinese Language.  Our upper secondary team reported on the growing trend of doodling in journals. The students interviewed teenagers on why they prefer hand drawn journal to the conventional journal and planner, as well as owners and shop assistants of journal shops.  The team comprised Jennifer Goh Mui Foong (4E4), Joachim Aw Man Ling (3E5), Lim Siang Yee (3E2) and Liow Lydia (3E5).

Our lower secondary team visited local Chinese bookstores to delve deeper on the diminishing trade of Chinese bookstores in Singapore. In doing so, they explored and reported on Chinese bookstores that have stood the test of time.  The team comprised Tan Jin Ying (1E5), Dai Lin Na Selena (1E5), Eng Jie Xuan (1E5) and Leow Lu Yu (1E5).
