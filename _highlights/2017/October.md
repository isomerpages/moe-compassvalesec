# 6TH NATIONAL CREATE YOUR OWN NEWSPAPER COMPETITION 2017

Our North Stars participated in the 6th National Create Your Own Newspaper Competition organised by The Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning, SPH Zbcomma and Xinmin Secondary School in July 2017.  Despite facing stiff competition from schools like Hwa Chong Institution, Nanyang Girls' High and CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School, our North stars have done us proud by clinching the **Silver Award and Best Layout Award in the Upper Secondary Category**, as well as the **Commendation Award in the Lower Secondary Category.**

Participants had first-hand experience at interviewing people and creating newspaper articles, learnt valuable skills and developed their passion for the Chinese Language.  Our upper secondary team reported on the growing trend of doodling in journals. The students interviewed teenagers on why they prefer hand drawn journal to the conventional journal and planner, as well as owners and shop assistants of journal shops.  The team comprised Jennifer Goh Mui Foong (4E4), Joachim Aw Man Ling (3E5), Lim Siang Yee (3E2) and Liow Lydia (3E5).

Our lower secondary team visited local Chinese bookstores to delve deeper on the diminishing trade of Chinese bookstores in Singapore. In doing so, they explored and reported on Chinese bookstores that have stood the test of time.  The team comprised Tan Jin Ying (1E5), Dai Lin Na Selena (1E5), Eng Jie Xuan (1E5) and Leow Lu Yu (1E5).

# SECONDARY 3 SERVICE LEARNING PROGRAMME 2017

As part of our school’s ‘Learning for Life Programme’ on Community & Youth Leadership – “Inspired North Stars Inspire Actions”, all Sec 3 students carry out self-initiated Values-in-Action projects to engage and meet the practical needs of the community in an authentic situation.  The programme empowers students to take ownership in the planning and implementation of various VIA projects to benefit the community.  
  
To ensure all students are equipped with the necessary knowledge and leadership skills, all of them attend a Service Learning workshop over 3 sessions, covering the stages of planning, preparation, execution and reflection, and understanding the importance of being a socially responsible citizen.  
  
This year, our students brought smiles to the residents at Sunlove Abode for the intellectually-infirmed, Bright Hill Evergreen Home for the Elderly, and for the first time, the Association for Persons with Special Needs (APSN) Centre for Adults at Kembangan-Chai Chee Community Hub.  The students engaged the residents and special needs friends through simple games such as bingo, collaborative art and craft projects.  They also helped the residents their daily routines, and accompanied the residents on outings to places such as the Peranakan Museum, Gardens by the Bay and the National Gallery of Singapore.

After carrying out the Service Learning projects, students reflected on the experiences gained and shared with their peers from across the level about their projects, learning points and key takeaways.

# GREEN COMPASS PROGRAMME 2017

As part of our school’s flagship environmental education programme – ‘Green Compass Programme’, all Sec 2 students were tasked to learn about upcycling and then apply what they learnt to create artefacts to enhance their classroom environment.  To prepare them for the task, all the students attended a series of talks and upcycling workshops conducted by the National Environment Agency (NEA) and the Singapore Environment Council (SEC).  At the workshops, students learnt how to use recyclable waste materials creatively and upcycle them for various uses, such as ornamental fairy gardens that utilise used cans, practical tote bags made from old t-shirts and recycled paper made from waste paper.  Each class had to come up with two upcycled artefacts which they deemed useful to their class or school environment.  Students got to see how each class created and made use of their artefacts. It was indeed a fruitful time of learning how to reduce the waste around us through innovation and put them to greater use. The students shared what they learnt with their school mates and presented their class’ upcycled artefacts in May.

Besides making a positive impact within CVSS, some of the students were also given opportunities to exhibit their upcycled artefacts and conduct paper recycling workshops for members of the public through outreach platforms such as ‘G!innovation’ and ‘Just One Earth Day’ co-organised by the North East CDC and NEA. By reaching out to the community, our green advocates hope to raise awareness on environmental issues and share their insights on green values and practices.
