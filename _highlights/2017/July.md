# Inaugural CVSS Alumni Homecoming Day – Reunite!
The CVSS Alumni EXCO organised the school’s very first CVSS Alumni Homecoming Day – Reunite! in the school hall on 1 July 2017. The Homecoming received strong support with over 200 alumni attending the event. It was a heart-warming affair as alumni from all 16 batches reunited at the place where memories were created and friendships were forged. They also managed to catch up with teachers who have taught them over the years.

The event started off with Mr Chia, our Principal, welcoming our alumni to their alma mater. Thereafter, Mr Lim Zi Rong, advisor to the CVSS Alumni EXCO, shared what the alumni stands for and how the alumni members can get involved. The highlight of the event was the Captain’s Ball Friendly Match, which attracted a total of 11 teams, with the oldest on the court from the class of 2004!  After many intense and exciting matches, the champions went to Darren Ngoh, Choo Zhi Xuan, Ryan Lim, Lim Xuan Cheng, Loh Yang Xian and Glenn Tan from the class of 2016!

The atmosphere was further liven up by our talented alumni performers during the Live Performance segment. Jane Chua (Class of 2011), one of our Alumni EXCO members, also conducted a Basic Watercolour Painting Workshop for our alumni where they tried their hands at basic floral painting and pen calligraphy!

The Alumni EXCO appreciates the strong support from the school, as well as all alumni members, helpers and performers for putting the event together, and looks forward to an annual homecoming in the years to come!
