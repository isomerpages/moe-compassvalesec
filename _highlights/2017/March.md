The Robotics Challenge seeks to cultivate students' interest in the area of engineering and also provides an excellent opportunity for them to gain first-hand experience in robot programming and interfacing. The event is an ideal platform for students to apply their technical skills and knowledge in robotics in a fun and competitive setting.  Our students had to build a robot that must avoid any collisions in an obstacles course in order to reach the final destination. They also had to program a robot that navigate along a designated track (i.e. black line on a white surface), where the track consists of straight lines, circular arcs and other obstacles such as bottles and humps which their robot must clear successfully.  It is indeed a challenging task for their robots to make it to the finishing point. Our students have worked hard to train for the competition and demonstrated their use of critical and creative thinking in building and programming of their robots. Our students also showed great resilience and displayed admirable sportsmanship throughout the competition. Their good behaviour, attitude and values indeed exemplify the North Star spirit.

# Nathan Hartono visits CVSS to Promote the Learning of Chinese Language
As part of the 2017 Mother Tongue (MT) Fortnight programme, the MT department collaborated with CPDD and the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning (推广华文学习委员会) to organise a special assembly programme on 13 Feb 2017 where Nathan Hartono appeared as the ambassador for the campaign “爱上华文” (loosely translated as ‘Falling in love with Chinese’).

There was good energy and vibrancy in the hall as the local crooner performed the Chinese pop favourites “有没有” - the song that catapulted him to fame in Sing! China (中国新声音) where he came in second at the finals in October 2016.  He also gave his own rendition of the famous song, “我不难过” originally sung by local singer Sun Yan Zi.
