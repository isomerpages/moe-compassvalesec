The Robotics Challenge seeks to cultivate students' interest in the area of engineering and also provides an excellent opportunity for them to gain first-hand experience in robot programming and interfacing. The event is an ideal platform for students to apply their technical skills and knowledge in robotics in a fun and competitive setting.  Our students had to build a robot that must avoid any collisions in an obstacles course in order to reach the final destination. They also had to program a robot that navigate along a designated track (i.e. black line on a white surface), where the track consists of straight lines, circular arcs and other obstacles such as bottles and humps which their robot must clear successfully.  It is indeed a challenging task for their robots to make it to the finishing point. Our students have worked hard to train for the competition and demonstrated their use of critical and creative thinking in building and programming of their robots. Our students also showed great resilience and displayed admirable sportsmanship throughout the competition. Their good behaviour, attitude and values indeed exemplify the North Star spirit.

# Nathan Hartono visits CVSS to Promote the Learning of Chinese Language
As part of the 2017 Mother Tongue (MT) Fortnight programme, the MT department collaborated with CPDD and the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning (推广华文学习委员会) to organise a special assembly programme on 13 Feb 2017 where Nathan Hartono appeared as the ambassador for the campaign “爱上华文” (loosely translated as ‘Falling in love with Chinese’).

There was good energy and vibrancy in the hall as the local crooner performed the Chinese pop favourites “有没有” - the song that catapulted him to fame in Sing! China (中国新声音) where he came in second at the finals in October 2016.  He also gave his own rendition of the famous song, “我不难过” originally sung by local singer Sun Yan Zi.

Coming from an English-speaking family, Hartono struggled with the learning of Chinese Language since primary school days when he took Higher Chinese in Primary 3 and was failing the subject continuously until secondary school. It was not until Junior College when he realised that mastering a second language would open up a lot of opportunities for him and started learning the language seriously.  To prepare for the Sing! Chinese contest, Hartono spent four months in China and improved from barely able to string together a proper sentence in Chinese to speaking complete sentences in Mandarin without pausing or inserting English words. He attributed his success to confidence in speaking proactively and constant practice.  
  
It is hoped that through the programme, our North Stars will be inspired to learn the Mother Tongue languages well and experience the joy of mastering it.

# Chinese New Year Celebration 2017
Our school celebrated the first and most excited festival of the year on 27 Jan, the eve of Chinese New Year.   To kick start the celebration, the lower secondary students took part in an inter-class rooster mascot competition, where each class designed a costume for their mascot using recycled materials, dressed up and paraded their mascot on stage.  This was followed by band and dance performances, a talent show where students showcased their vocal talents, alumni performances, a skit by our drama club about Chinese New Year customs and festive singing by our choir.  
  
As in the past years, our school did not forget to invite senior citizens to join in the celebrations.  This year we invited 5 residents from the Bright Hill Evergreen Home for the elderly and 20 elderly Residents’ Committee members from neighbouring Compassvale Lodge.  Our SAC Chairman, Mr Lee Kang Hwa continued his tradition of giving out hong baos to our elderly guests and our Parent Support Group also specially prepared hampers for all of them.   Our students also gave the elderly and our teachers mandarin oranges, showing respect for the elders and gratitude for the teachers.

# China Suzhou School Exchange and Cultural Immersion Trip 2016
38 North Stars, 5 teachers and our Principal went on our school’s China Suzhou School Exchange and Cultural Immersion programme in Nov 2016.  The students and teachers had a meaningful two days of school exchange with our twinning school - Suzhou Industrial Park Xinggang School. After a simple welcoming ceremony and introduction to Suzhou, the students attended lessons with their Xinggang buddies, including two specially-planned lessons in Music and Geography. During the music lesson, they learnt a traditional song in the Suzhou dialect (ping tan) and tried their hands at playing a traditional musical instrument (san xuan). During the geography lesson, they worked in groups to plan an itinerary to visit places of attraction in Suzhou.  Our students not only experienced a different learning environment but also built friendships with their China buddies through these activities.

Our students also visited numerous places of historical and cultural significance in Hangzhou, Suzhou, Nanjing, Wuxi and Shanghai. They were exposed to Chinese History, Literature and the Arts as they learnt about stories of heroism, loyalty and piety. In addition, they learnt to appreciate the strong bilateral ties between China and Singapore as they explored the exhibits at Suzhou-Singapore Industrial Park Museum. The students were also taken in on the close similarity between the mix of colonial heritage and modern skyline in Shanghai and our downtown CBD. Additionally, the exhibits at the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall deepened their appreciation of the horrors of war and the importance of regional peace and stability.  
  
Indeed, the entire trip was filled with numerous opportunities to gain new knowledge and forge good friendships and our students captured many moments of learning and camaraderie.
