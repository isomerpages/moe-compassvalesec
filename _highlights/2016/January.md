2016 began on a high note for the graduating cohort of 2015 as they received their GCE O-Level Examinations results.   
  
Among the North Stars from the Express stream, Teo Kai Ling, Kleio Tan, Zhou Kevin Wu, and Leow Zhen Xiang are well-rounded achievers who have truly exemplified the virtues of conscientious students, with a passion for living and learning.  
  
Teo Kai Ling achieved seven distinctions in the GCE O-Level Examinations.  She was an Executive Committee Member in the Student Council Board and the chairperson of Environment Club.  In recognition of her leadership qualities and meritorious contributions to her CCA, she was awarded the Edusave Awards for Achievement, Good Leadership and Service (EAGLES) (Leadership) in 2013 and 2014. Kai Ling is also a compassionate student who served the community by volunteering in numerous organisations. With good time management skills, she also struck a good balance between her studies and CCA.  
  
Another well-rounded North Star is Kleio Tan, who was Head of the Student Council Board and the chairperson of Choir. With discipline and tenacity, she led the Choir to achieve a Certification of Distinction in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation in 2015. She is also an Edusave Character Award holder as well as a recipient of the EAGLES (Leadership) in 2014. Her commitment towards her studies in spite of her heavy CCA commitments has helped her attain six distinctions.  
  
A dynamic student leader who led by example, Zhou Kevin Wu earned the respect of his peers in his years in CVSS. He was an Executive Committee Member in the Student Council Board and the chairperson of Dance CCA. He led the Dance CCA to achieve a Certificate of Distinction in the SYF Arts Presentation 2015. Kevin’s commitment towards achieving excellence earned him six distinctions.  
  
For his contributions as a Student Councillor and vice-chairperson of the Boys’ Brigade, Leow Zhen Xiang was awarded the EAGLES (Leadership) in 2014. He was also a recipient of the prestigious Boys’ Brigade Founder’s Award in 2015.  His consistent efforts in his studies enabled him to achieve five distinctions.  
  
Our Sec 5N(A) students have also made the school proud. Lim Xinyi, who was a Student Councillor and Assistant Company Leader of Girls Guides, managed her CCA responsibilities and studies well during her time in CVSS. She scored two distinctions in her examinations.  

This milestone marks the completion of yet another meaningful journey of learning in the lives of the North Stars. As they set forth to scale greater heights in their chosen paths, may they always carry with them the zest for life and the zeal to learn.

# Asia Pacific Youth Robotics Competition 2015
The Asia Pacific Youth Robotics Competition 2015 is a skills competition organised specifically for the Primary, Secondary and Tertiary students held by the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). It promotes the use of creativity and problem solving skills among students through the use of engineering science and technology.  
  
Our North Stars have done us proud by emerging in the 2nd place in Mission Programming and 3rd placing in the Line Tracing segment. These students from PA/AVA (Robotics) worked hard to train for the competition and demonstrated their use of critical and creative thinking skills in the building and programming of their Lego robots. They also showed great resilience as they worked through unexpected challenges during the competition.
