<img src="/images/oslp.jpeg" 
     style="width:80%">
As part of our Learning for Life Programme in Community & Youth Leadership, our school organises an overseas service learning project every year to neighbouring countries (Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam etc) for student leaders to make a difference to other communities, inculcate our school values of graciousness, empathy and resilience, and develop leadership and project management skills.  
  
For 2016, 32 students and 4 teachers led by one of our Vice-Principals, embarked on a 7 days 6 nights Overseas Service Learning Project to Ho Chi Minh CIty, Vietnam in September.

This year, our students visited Tran Van On Primary School for the second time to teach the Vietnamese pupils English and Mathematics through songs, games and Art & Craft, as well as organise mini sports and games which were well-enjoyed by all.  Our students also helped improve the school infrastructure and environment such as cementing the floor of the courtyard and classrooms, building a brick fence and painting a wall mural.

The trip also provided a valuable opportunity for our students to learn about the history, culture, practices and livelihood in Vietnam.  These include visits to the War Remnants Museum, Cu Chi Tunnel, Re-unification Palace, Post Office, Notre Dame Cathedral.  Students also visited a bee farm to learn about local products and making coconut candy from scratch during the Mekong Delta Land Tour, as well as watched a Water Puppet Show to appreciate traditional Vietnamese arts.  As much as they have served the local community, our students have also learnt much from the locals and have learnt to appreciate what they have at home. They have gained many precious memories and experiences and would share what they have learnt with their fellow schoolmates upon their return.

**10th Interschool Theatresports Competition**

In the 10th Interschool Theatresports Competition organised by Dunman High School, our students clinched a **Team 4th Position** and the hotly contested **Most Creative Team Award** despite facing intense competition from traditional powerhouses like Nanyang Girls’ High and River Valley High School.  Theatresports is improvisational theatre done in a competitive way for dramatic effects. Competing teams had to perform scenes based on random suggestions and adapt to spontaneous changes requested by the judges. The competition aims to provide contestants with the opportunity of learning CL in an engaging and innovative way. Through Theatresports, students also learn to work collaboratively in teams, building up their self-esteem and confidence along the way and putting their critical and creative thinking to the test.  
  
Our students involved in the competition were Lee Jia Qian Valerie (1E4), Cheung Chun On (2E2), Lee Yong Sheng (2E2), Koh Zhi Rong (2E4), Cheung Yuen Ling (4E1) and Zenise Tey (4N3)

**North 3 School Cluster Malay Scrabble Competition 2016**

In the annual N3 Cluster Malay Scrabble Competition held at Pei Hwa Secondary School, our students were crowned **Champions in both lower and upper secondary categories** despite facing stiff competition from other schools in the N3 cluster. The icing on the cake was when our students, Fatin Humaira Bte Mohd Ashik (Sec 2E1) and Siti Farzlinda Bte Misran (Sec 3E1) also emerged **individual 1st and 2nd** in their respective categories.  
  
The competition was organised to encourage and enhance vocabulary building amongst participants and open their world to the beauty of the Malay Language through the engaging Sahibba game, which is equivalent to Scrabble.  Students had to build as many words as they could from a pile of tiles within a time limit. This allowed them to hone their confidence, calmness and the ability to strategize their game-play by purposeful interceptions and quick thinking.  
  
Our team comprised the following students:
