As part of our Learning for Life Programme in Community & Youth Leadership, our school organises an overseas service learning project every year to neighbouring countries (Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam etc) for student leaders to make a difference to other communities, inculcate our school values of graciousness, empathy and resilience, and develop leadership and project management skills.  
  
For 2016, 32 students and 4 teachers led by one of our Vice-Principals, embarked on a 7 days 6 nights Overseas Service Learning Project to Ho Chi Minh CIty, Vietnam in September.

This year, our students visited Tran Van On Primary School for the second time to teach the Vietnamese pupils English and Mathematics through songs, games and Art & Craft, as well as organise mini sports and games which were well-enjoyed by all.  Our students also helped improve the school infrastructure and environment such as cementing the floor of the courtyard and classrooms, building a brick fence and painting a wall mural.

The trip also provided a valuable opportunity for our students to learn about the history, culture, practices and livelihood in Vietnam.  These include visits to the War Remnants Museum, Cu Chi Tunnel, Re-unification Palace, Post Office, Notre Dame Cathedral.  Students also visited a bee farm to learn about local products and making coconut candy from scratch during the Mekong Delta Land Tour, as well as watched a Water Puppet Show to appreciate traditional Vietnamese arts.  As much as they have served the local community, our students have also learnt much from the locals and have learnt to appreciate what they have at home. They have gained many precious memories and experiences and would share what they have learnt with their fellow schoolmates upon their return.
