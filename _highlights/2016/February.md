The ITE Robotics Challenge is an annual event organised by the School of Engineering at ITE College East for all secondary school students on a national platform.  The competition was held on 3 Feb 2016 at ITE College East this year.  Our school competed against many other schools, including Anderson Secondary, Bukit Panjang Govt High, CHIJ Secondary, Chua Chu Kang Secondary, Coral Secondary, Dunman Secondary and Swiss Cottage Secondary.  We are proud to share that our students have clinched **First placing and 2nd Runner-up in the Line Tracing category and 2nd Runner-up and Merit awards in the Obstacle Challenge category**.  
  
The competition seeks to cultivate students' interest in the area of engineering and also provides an excellent opportunity for them to gain first-hand experience in robot programming and interfacing. It is also an ideal platform for students to apply their technical skills and knowledge in robotics in a fun and competitive setting.  Our students had to build a robot that must avoid any collisions in an obstacles course in order to reach the final destination. They also had to program and navigate a robot to move along a designated track (i.e. black line on a white surface), which consists of straight lines, circular arcs and other obstacles such as bottles and humps that the robot must clear successfully.  
  
It is indeed a challenging task to navigate the robots to the finishing point. Our students have worked hard to train for the competition and demonstrated their use of critical and creative thinking in building and programming their robots.  They have also shown great resilience and good sportsmanship throughout the competition. Their good behaviour, attitude and values indeed exemplify the North Star spirit.
