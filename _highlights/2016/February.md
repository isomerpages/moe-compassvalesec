The ITE Robotics Challenge is an annual event organised by the School of Engineering at ITE College East for all secondary school students on a national platform.  The competition was held on 3 Feb 2016 at ITE College East this year.  Our school competed against many other schools, including Anderson Secondary, Bukit Panjang Govt High, CHIJ Secondary, Chua Chu Kang Secondary, Coral Secondary, Dunman Secondary and Swiss Cottage Secondary.  We are proud to share that our students have clinched **First placing and 2nd Runner-up in the Line Tracing category and 2nd Runner-up and Merit awards in the Obstacle Challenge category**.  
  
The competition seeks to cultivate students' interest in the area of engineering and also provides an excellent opportunity for them to gain first-hand experience in robot programming and interfacing. It is also an ideal platform for students to apply their technical skills and knowledge in robotics in a fun and competitive setting.  Our students had to build a robot that must avoid any collisions in an obstacles course in order to reach the final destination. They also had to program and navigate a robot to move along a designated track (i.e. black line on a white surface), which consists of straight lines, circular arcs and other obstacles such as bottles and humps that the robot must clear successfully.  
  
It is indeed a challenging task to navigate the robots to the finishing point. Our students have worked hard to train for the competition and demonstrated their use of critical and creative thinking in building and programming their robots.  They have also shown great resilience and good sportsmanship throughout the competition. Their good behaviour, attitude and values indeed exemplify the North Star spirit.

# CVSS Chinese New Year Celebration 2016

Our school celebrated Chinese New Year on Friday, 15 January to usher in the year of the Monkey.​ The celebration was launched with a big bang by Mr Chia, our Principal, and Mr Lee, Chairman of the School Advisory Committee, striking a traditional gong simultaneously on a beautifully decorated stage in our school hall. A string of entertaining performances and exciting programmes followed for all staff and students to enjoy. Our CCA groups – Dance, Wushu, Band and Choir showcased their many talents as they enthralled the crowd before them.  Members of our Alumni presented an energetic and youthful dance item, and danced to popular tunes together with the ‘God of Fortune’ mascot.  The highlights were the “Guess My Voice” segment where students had to guess the identity of the staff member strutting their vocal talents behind the hall curtains, and the pre-recorded videos of new year greetings from young children of our teachers of different races where the students had to guess the identify of their parents! Every Chinese New Year, our staff and students devote themselves to contributing back to the community and bring joy to others in the community.  As usual, our school invited more than 40 senior citizens from Henderson Heights to have a sumptuous breakfast together with our teachers and Parent Support Group members before joining us in the celebrations. Every elderly guest received a _hongbao_ each from Mr Lee personally and from Mr Chia on behalf of the staff. Our Parent Support Group also presented each of them with a special hamper packed by PSG members.
