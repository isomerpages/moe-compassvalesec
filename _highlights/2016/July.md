# Ready For The World Programme

World Ready Youths – the school’s vision attests to our commitment to ensuring that every North Star graduates with the necessary knowledge, skills, values and attitudes that will hold them in good stead for their future. Thus, it is only apt that for their final lap with the school, the Secondary 4 and 5 students go through the Ready for the World Seminar – a three-day programme specially organised to equip them with the necessary life-skills to thrive upon graduation.  
  
The seminar, conducted from 9 to 11 March 2016, was designed with several objectives in mind. First, it is to enable students to gain self-awareness of their unique personalities and recognise its implication. Next, it aims to enable students to gain a better understanding on the importance of planning for their finances, career and marriage and finally, to equip them with the knowledge, skills and values required to help them make informed and responsible decisions.  
  
To achieve these objectives, different important aspects of their life were focused on each day of the seminar. The first day put a spotlight on their personality and financial literacy. The second day concentrated on education and career guidance. The seminar rounded off with an emphasis on sexuality education.

Day 1 – Personal Effectiveness Lifeskills  
  
The seminar kick-started with a keynote address by our very own former student – Mr Stanwin Siow \[Assistant Vice President, Investment Banking Technology Risk (Asia Pacific), Barclays Bank\], who shared with the current North Stars on how they could and should get themselves ready for the world. They listened with awe and were enraptured by the advice he gave, as he related learning points from his life journey as a North Star till his current role in Barclays.

Two workshops – Personality Profiling and Financial Literacy – were conducted for the students. The Personality Profiling Workshop allowed students to understand the importance of knowing oneself – their strengths and weaknesses – so that they would be able to make more informed decisions when mapping their tertiary education and career. Through the hands-on activities, the diverse ways that each personality functions were made apparent to the North Stars. _“Trust my own instincts as even though they are different from those made by my friends, it is alright since we have different personalities,’_ wrote Valerie Yong of Sec 4E3, in her reflection journal.  
  
The North Stars also attended the Financial Literacy workshop which was organised with the goal of getting them to realise the need to be financially prudent and to impart them with skills to manage their finances. An overwhelming majority of the North Stars agreed that they would be able to apply the knowledge that they gained from the workshop. As Lim Siying of Sec 4N3 reflected, _“I will spend whatever is within my means and not overspend but I must have some savings. I will then have money for rainy days.”_ The same message was also conveyed by Richard Ben of Sec 4T1 who shared that _“The session has taught me to differentiate my needs from wants and to plan my finances wisely.”  
  
_As the most senior members of the school, our Sec 5 students went through a workshop on Resume Writing and Interview Skills. Through the workshop, students learnt the proper way to conduct themselves during interviews and how to prepare a good resume. They had an enjoyable and fruitful time through role-play activities. Joel Lee of Sec 5N2 noted, _“To be better prepared for interviews in the future, I must be aware of my attire and my body language so that I would score a better chance in getting a job.”_
