It was certainly a day to remember for our Normal course students as they received their results for the GCE N-Level Examinations 2016. For the school, it was also a momentous occasion when hard work and excellence in both academic and non-academic pursuits were celebrated.

Yang Jin Murphy of 4N3 and Clarabel Ng Zi Le of 4N1 are our top well-rounded achievers in the Normal Academic course. Murphy obtained an EMB3\* _(\*Aggregate score of grades_ _in English, Mathematics and Best Three other Subjects)_ of 9 points with 3 distinctions, while Clarabel achieved 6 points with 6 distinctions. Besides doing well academically, these students were also outstanding in non-academic areas. Murphy was Student Councillor and Vice-Chairperson of the National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC). Clarabel served as a Class Leader in the capacity of a Class Chairperson and a committed member in the Netball team.

The other students who also did well are Tan Chung Seng Spencer of 4N3 and Rashini D Selvasegaran of 4N1. A dedicated member of the Boys’ Brigade who achieved the rank of Corporal, Spencer obtained an EMB3 of 7 points and 4 distinctions. An active member of the Videography Club, Rashini attained a National Youth Achievement Award (NYAA) (Silver) in recognition of her commitment towards non-academic development. She achieved an EMB3 of 9 points and 5 distinctions.

Other well-rounded achievers include Amanda Mah Xiu Min and Zenise Tey of 4N3. Both Student Councillors, Amanda and Zenise contributed actively in school and in their CCAs, serving as Vice-Chairperson of Girl Guides and National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) respectively. Both of them scored an EMB3 of 11 points and attained 3 distinctions.

Among the students from the Normal Technical course, Richard Branson Ben and Lim Cheng Hwee of 4T1 both attained an impressive 4 distinctions. Richard was the Deputy Company Sergeant Major of the Boys’ Brigade, and obtained a NYAA Silver Award. A member of the Environment Club, Cheng Hwee obtained a NYAA Bronze award.  In addition, Sia Long Yew Bryan and Muhamad Irfan B Mohamad Rizam of 4T1 both scored 3 distinctions. Bryan was a member of the Environment Club and obtained the NYAA Bronze Award, while Irfan was a dedicated member of the school Choir who received the Edusave Merit Bursary for 3 consecutive years from 2013 to 2015

Another student who was affirmed was Irham Irsyad B Azman of 4N2. In the course of his studies, Irham faced challenging circumstances at home which prevented him from fully focusing on his academic pursuits. Unable to cope at one point, Irham repeated his Secondary 3 year. With the support of his teachers and school counsellor, Irham eventually found motivation to spur himself towards doing his best, and has demonstrated resilience in the process. He attained an EMB3 of 14 points and 3 distinctions. The school is truly proud of how far he has come.
