# SECONDARY 3 SERVICE LEARNING PROGRAMME 2016

The Secondary 3 Service Learning Programme involves all Sec 3 students in carrying out **self-initiated Values-in-Action projects** to engage and meet the needs of the community. This is part of our school’s Learning for Life Programme on Community & Youth Leadership - “Inspired North Stars Inspire Actions”.  
  
The programme focuses on experiential learning though authentic situations.  To ensure students are equipped with the necessary knowledge and leadership skills, all of them attend a Service Learning Workshop conducted after school over 3 sessions.  The workshop emphasizes the importance of being a socially responsible citizen and provides opportunities for participants to apply various leadership skills during the stages of planning, preparation, execution and reflection.  In the course of carrying out the VIA projects, students learn how to design meaningful activities that will benefit different communities.  By empowering students with the autonomy to plan and carry out the projects, the school fosters student ownership over how they can contribute to the community.

This year, our Sec 3 students brought smiles to the residents at Bright Hill Evergreen Home and Sunlove Abode for the intellectually-infirmed. To meet the needs of the elderly residents at Bright Hill Evergreen Home, our students engaged the residents through performances at the home, sprucing up the environment of the home through spring cleaning and gardening, and taking the elderly out for strolls in the vicinity.

After carrying out the service learning projects, our students reflected on the experiences gained and more importantly, showed their appreciation towards one another. As a way to encourage the heart and celebrate successes and accomplishments, our students were treated to yummy ice cream sponsored by Touch Youth!

# CVSS GREEN COMPASS PROGRAMME 2016
Our school’s annual Secondary 2 community recycling programme – **Green Compass Programme** was held on 25May 2016 for all Sec 2 students to serve the Sengkang community.  This is part of our school’s Learning for Life Programme on Community & Youth Leadership - “Inspired North Stars Inspire Actions”.    Eight Sec 2 classes collected recyclable items such as magazines, books, newspapers and clothes from more than 47 HDB blocks in the vicinity of the school for recycling. Members of our Parent Support Group also helped out in the collection efforts.  
  
A week before the collection, all students went to these blocks to inform the residents about the recycling project and our school’s service to the community.  Seizing on the opportunity, they also distributed flyers on dengue prevention in partnership with National Environment Agency (NEA). To prepare for this, the students attended a NEA talk earlier in the year on upcycling and dengue fever, which enabled them to speak with more conviction with the residents on these issues.  Through the programme, our North Stars developed and displayed the values of resilience and graciousness, and also gained valuable soft skills such as communication, teamwork and project management.
