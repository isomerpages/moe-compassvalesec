# SECONDARY 3 SERVICE LEARNING PROGRAMME 2016

The Secondary 3 Service Learning Programme involves all Sec 3 students in carrying out **self-initiated Values-in-Action projects** to engage and meet the needs of the community. This is part of our school’s Learning for Life Programme on Community & Youth Leadership - “Inspired North Stars Inspire Actions”.  
  
The programme focuses on experiential learning though authentic situations.  To ensure students are equipped with the necessary knowledge and leadership skills, all of them attend a Service Learning Workshop conducted after school over 3 sessions.  The workshop emphasizes the importance of being a socially responsible citizen and provides opportunities for participants to apply various leadership skills during the stages of planning, preparation, execution and reflection.  In the course of carrying out the VIA projects, students learn how to design meaningful activities that will benefit different communities.  By empowering students with the autonomy to plan and carry out the projects, the school fosters student ownership over how they can contribute to the community.

This year, our Sec 3 students brought smiles to the residents at Bright Hill Evergreen Home and Sunlove Abode for the intellectually-infirmed. To meet the needs of the elderly residents at Bright Hill Evergreen Home, our students engaged the residents through performances at the home, sprucing up the environment of the home through spring cleaning and gardening, and taking the elderly out for strolls in the vicinity.

After carrying out the service learning projects, our students reflected on the experiences gained and more importantly, showed their appreciation towards one another. As a way to encourage the heart and celebrate successes and accomplishments, our students were treated to yummy ice cream sponsored by Touch Youth!
