# SECONDARY 3 SERVICE LEARNING PROGRAMME 2016

The Secondary 3 Service Learning Programme involves all Sec 3 students in carrying out **self-initiated Values-in-Action projects** to engage and meet the needs of the community. This is part of our school’s Learning for Life Programme on Community & Youth Leadership - “Inspired North Stars Inspire Actions”.  
  
The programme focuses on experiential learning though authentic situations.  To ensure students are equipped with the necessary knowledge and leadership skills, all of them attend a Service Learning Workshop conducted after school over 3 sessions.  The workshop emphasizes the importance of being a socially responsible citizen and provides opportunities for participants to apply various leadership skills during the stages of planning, preparation, execution and reflection.  In the course of carrying out the VIA projects, students learn how to design meaningful activities that will benefit different communities.  By empowering students with the autonomy to plan and carry out the projects, the school fosters student ownership over how they can contribute to the community.

This year, our Sec 3 students brought smiles to the residents at Bright Hill Evergreen Home and Sunlove Abode for the intellectually-infirmed. To meet the needs of the elderly residents at Bright Hill Evergreen Home, our students engaged the residents through performances at the home, sprucing up the environment of the home through spring cleaning and gardening, and taking the elderly out for strolls in the vicinity.

After carrying out the service learning projects, our students reflected on the experiences gained and more importantly, showed their appreciation towards one another. As a way to encourage the heart and celebrate successes and accomplishments, our students were treated to yummy ice cream sponsored by Touch Youth!

# CVSS GREEN COMPASS PROGRAMME 2016
Our school’s annual Secondary 2 community recycling programme – **Green Compass Programme** was held on 25May 2016 for all Sec 2 students to serve the Sengkang community.  This is part of our school’s Learning for Life Programme on Community & Youth Leadership - “Inspired North Stars Inspire Actions”.    Eight Sec 2 classes collected recyclable items such as magazines, books, newspapers and clothes from more than 47 HDB blocks in the vicinity of the school for recycling. Members of our Parent Support Group also helped out in the collection efforts.  
  
A week before the collection, all students went to these blocks to inform the residents about the recycling project and our school’s service to the community.  Seizing on the opportunity, they also distributed flyers on dengue prevention in partnership with National Environment Agency (NEA). To prepare for this, the students attended a NEA talk earlier in the year on upcycling and dengue fever, which enabled them to speak with more conviction with the residents on these issues.  Through the programme, our North Stars developed and displayed the values of resilience and graciousness, and also gained valuable soft skills such as communication, teamwork and project management.

# CVSS Volunteers with Metta Welfare Association

In CVSS, every CCA is expected to undertake a Values-in-Action community service project every year.  On 20 March 2016, Sunday, 56 Band members and 14 Librarians, together with 3 parents volunteered their services with Metta Welfare Association during the annual Metta Charity Carnival.  The Librarians set up a bowling game booth and much effort was put in to plan the game and prepare the prizes and handmade gifts for all participants. The Band members performed a series of pop songs and practised for their performance since January, even during the March school vacation.

_It was heart-warming to see so many people coming from different backgrounds coming together for a greater cause. There were entire families, elderly couples, and an old lady with her grandson all willing to try out our bowling game. Some were buying goods that were more expensive than the usual price just for charity. Seeing this really made me respect these people as they were setting a good example for their kids and instilling good values in them from young._<br>
_After the carnival, there were many of us who felt accomplished. All our hard work was worth it. The smiles on the faces of those children who had visited our booth filled us with joy. All of us have found this a worthwhile experience as we got to have fun while doing something good for the society.”_<br>
_– Reflection written by Tasha Khor Pei Xin and Eugene Chua Yee Shuen of Class 3E5_

_On 20th March, our school Band participated in the Metta Charity Carnival held at Metta Building, organised by Metta Welfare Association. Metta, which means ‘loving kindness’, aims to provide welfare services for the community, regardless of race or religion. It is committed to working closely with various parties for the provision of welfare services to meet the needs of the community at their centres and to enhance their clients' quality of life. The charity carnival aimed to raise funds to support the development and enrichment of disability care, medical care, special education and early intervention programmes that Metta provides to the community._

_As Band is a Performing Arts, we believe that one of the ways we can contribute to the society is to harness our talents for a good cause such as putting up public performances to bring joy to others._

_To prepare for this performance, the Band has put in hours of practice as we rehearsed on several pop songs such as ‘One Direction in Concert’ and ‘Best Day of my Life’. We put in our best effort during every practice as we know that it is for a meaningful purpose. Even though the performance was only a small segment of the entire charity carnival, we had an enjoyable time entertaining the audience with our music. Despite the sweltering heat and the confined space on stage, were were very resilient and continued playing with enthusiasm and confidence. We also demonstrated graciousness as we helped to set the stage up neatly before our performance and cleared the stage quickly for the next group of performers. The smiles and applause we received encouraged us and kept us going. At the end of our performance, one of the audiences came up to our instructor and complimented the Band! We felt a great sense of satisfaction as our hard work has paid off!_

_Through this experience, we have gained greater awareness on the needs of others in the society. We learn to be more grateful for our blessings and empathise with those who are less fortunate than us. We also realise that there are many ways to contribute to the society and that every gesture, no matter how small it may seem, can go a long way. Through this VIA, we were able to put into practice the values that the school has inculcated in us and become more concerned citizens.”_

Our NCC (Air) cadets also performed a free style drill entitled ‘Unity as One’.  With music, hand movement and footdrill, a free style drill brings together a higher level of challenge which requires strong discipline, creativity and teamwork among the performers.  In line with this year's National Day theme - "Building our Singapore of Tomorrow" which seeks to galvanise and unite Singaporeans in the next chapter of nation building, the spirit of this performance highlights the importance of being a good team player and how building a nation does not just fall in the hands of one person, but every citizen of Singapore.

# Student Art Achievements 2016
Our school submitted 4 student artworks for this year’s **Singapore Youth Festival Art Exhibition** – two from lower secondary and two from upper secondary, which were featured in the exhibition print catalogue. The lower secondary artworks were selected from our Sec 2 Art ‘Social Activism Painting Project’ while the upper secondary artworks were selected from our Sec 4 Normal Academic Art students.  
  
One of our participating students, Chua Si Wei from Sec 5N3 had his artwork selected for the **on-site exhibition** held at the Arts House and was awarded a **Certificate of Recognition**. Si Wei’s acrylic paint artwork, titled ‘The Hot Seat’, was one of 221 selected artworks out of a total of 533 entries. His artwork expressed his emotions and feelings when commuting daily in public transport, and reflected the metaphor of likening getting a seat on the MRT to everyone striving to succeed in life amidst our hectic society.

A team of our Secondary 3 NA Art students took part in the **International Youth Floral Art Competition** held on 28 July, titled Floral Harmony @ Nanyang 2016 and won a **Merit Award (Floor Arrangement)**.  
  
The objectives of the competition were to promote artistic appreciation and interest in floral art, to provide an international platform for youths to showcase their talents and to contribute to the community through floral art activities.  Participants planned and prepared the structure for the flowers prior to the competition and the given set of flowers were only shown to the participants on competition day.  
  
Despite taking part in the competition for the first time and the nature of the competition that is not based on drawing and painting, our team comprising Chia Pei En, Sheryl Yeap, Rachel Yoong, Muhammad Danish and Gavin Goh (all from Sec 3N1) demonstrated resilience, perseverance and teamwork and performed well to win a Merit Award for floor arrangement.  They exercised their creative and critical thinking and created a structure with the theme of “Reaching Up”. The wooden structure has the bigger parts at the bottom and gradually reduces in size as it reaches the top, to emphasise scale and proportion.
