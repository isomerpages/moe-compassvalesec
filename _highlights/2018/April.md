It was a time of great jubilation for our school at the Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition (SAFMC) Awards Ceremony held in the Singapore Science Centre on 7 April 2018.  The competition was held over several days.  A record of more than 400 teams from 84 schools participated in the SAFMC this year. Our North Stars swept 8 awards and clinched the coveted **Championship Award, 1st Place** in the Unpowered Gliders category, the highest award a team could win based on overall excellence shown in all aspects of the competition. This is the first time our school clinched the championship award in the competition's 10 year history and our third participation since 2016.
