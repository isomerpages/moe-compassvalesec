# Finalists for The Shell Singapore Bright Ideas Challenge

[Video for the Bright Ideas Challenge Feat\_CVSS](https://youtu.be/URqL0N1GRYg)

Our students took part in the Bright Ideas Challenge which was a national competition organized by Science Centre Singapore in partnership with Shell Singapore and supported by MOE and **one of our teams made it to the finals despite the school participating in the competition for the first time!**  The team did a project to build an optimized design of the _Eco-cooler_ and make it more scalable to cater to the users’ needs. The _Eco-cooler_ uses zero-electricity to cool down hot wind by up to 11 °C based on the _Venturi effect_ thus eliminating the heavy reliance on air-conditioning.  **Despite being the youngest finalist team**, the students presented their project confidently to a panel of judges from Shell and Science Centre Singapore and done the school proud by clinching a **Merit Award** with $300 worth of prizes.  The team also got to present their project and poster infographic at the ‘Make The Future’ (MTF) festival held at the Changi Exhibition Centre on 8th and 9th of March 2018, to the Guest-of-Honour, Mr S Iswaran, Minister of Trade and Industry and many visitors to the festival.
