# Finalists for The Shell Singapore Bright Ideas Challenge

[Video for the Bright Ideas Challenge Feat\_CVSS](https://youtu.be/URqL0N1GRYg)

Our students took part in the Bright Ideas Challenge which was a national competition organized by Science Centre Singapore in partnership with Shell Singapore and supported by MOE and **one of our teams made it to the finals despite the school participating in the competition for the first time!**  The team did a project to build an optimized design of the _Eco-cooler_ and make it more scalable to cater to the users’ needs. The _Eco-cooler_ uses zero-electricity to cool down hot wind by up to 11 °C based on the _Venturi effect_ thus eliminating the heavy reliance on air-conditioning.  **Despite being the youngest finalist team**, the students presented their project confidently to a panel of judges from Shell and Science Centre Singapore and done the school proud by clinching a **Merit Award** with $300 worth of prizes.  The team also got to present their project and poster infographic at the ‘Make The Future’ (MTF) festival held at the Changi Exhibition Centre on 8th and 9th of March 2018, to the Guest-of-Honour, Mr S Iswaran, Minister of Trade and Industry and many visitors to the festival.

The competition aims to spark young people’s curiosity in science and engineering and to inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers and innovators. Students were challenged to come up with creative ideas of how cities of the future might be powered to be vibrant, healthy and clean places to live in.  In groups of 2 to 5, students had to conceptualize a solution that tackles an energy crisis in the year 2050. Out of over 60 project proposals that were submitted in October last year, 10 were shortlisted to develop their ideas further by building them into prototypes in the finals.  
  

Since the start of the year, our award winning team had several rounds of ideating, prototyping and testing their project idea. In the months leading up to the final judging at the ‘Make The Future’ (MTF) festival, the team visited Shell Singapore, discussed their idea with a Shell mentor and have a hands-on session at the Digital Fabrication Space at the Singapore Science Centre to learn about computer-aided designing, 3D printing and other technologies.
