# Achievements in Science Competitions 2018

As part of our school efforts to develop our strengths in teaching and learning of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math), the Science Department has strived to imbue a passion for science and innovation in our students.  Students who show a keen interest and aptitude for Science are given the opportunity to participate in external competitions where they are involved in real-world problem solving through scientific investigations under the mentorship of their Science teachers. Our students have done us proud by their recent achievements in various national-level Science competitions in Semester two.

**Singapore Youth Science Fair – Two Distinction Awards**

On 25th July, two teams of North Stars participated in the Singapore Youth Science Fair (SYSF) and both clinched the highest honour of **Distinction Award** in the Lower Secondary Category.   The science fair is an annual scientific research competition co-organized by the Science Teachers Association of Singapore and Science Centre Singapore to promote scientific study through investigation, encourage creativity and innovation through problem-solving and heighten awareness of scientific research and technology development.  The two teams worked on their project over the span of three months. The first team investigated the efficacy of certain home-based extraction methods of common herbs as antimicrobial agents, while the second group investigated the effectiveness of a modified Eco-cooler in lowering the temperature of ambient air. This culminated in the teams writing a report and designing a poster to summarize their findings and producing a 5-minute video presentation to present their results.

**East Zone A\*STAR Science Fair – Merit Award**

On 17th July, a team of Sec 3 students participated in the above competition organised by Victoria Junior College in collaboration with the Agency for Science, Technology and Research to promote scientific research and the sharing of ideas amongst secondary school students.  Despite facing stiff competition from schools participating in the Open Category, including schools that are well-established in Science Research such as NUS High School of Mathematics and Science, Raffles Institution and Hwa Chong Institution, our team achieved a **Merit Award** for their investigation on the biodegradation of different plastic polymers by mealworms.  It was an eye-opening experience for our students to see the advanced research methods and techniques on display at the Science Fair and to have the opportunity to visit the state-of-the-art Science Laboratory facilities at the NJC Science Research Centre to loan the use of the laboratory's sophisticated analytical equipment to analyse the results of their scientific investigation.

**17th Elementz Science Research Competition (Lower Secondary) – Bronze Award**

On 23rd July, two teams of Sec 2 students took part in the above competition organised by Anderson Secondary School which aims to provide students with a platform to showcase their aptitude in Science inquiry and problem solving. A total of 81 teams from various primary and secondary schools took part in the competition where they had to conceptualize an investigative-type project with the theme of "Changing the World, One Idea at a Time". They then had to perform experiments, produce a report for submission and present their projects to a panel of three judges. Our teams submitted two projects titled "Investigating the efficacy of home-based extraction methods for common herbs as anti-microbial agents" and "Investigating the use of the thermoelectric effect to generate electricity".  One of the teams clinched a **Bronze** award.

**Singapore Junior Physics Olympiad (SJPO) – Honourable Mention**

The annual SJPO 2018 is a physics competition organized by the Institute of Physics, Singapore for secondary school students.  It aims to encourage the study and appreciation of physics beyond the school curriculum, by providing an opportunity for students to solve novel questions that require critical and inventive thinking.  Despite it being our first time taking part in this national-level competition, Maung Sue Htaik Aung (4E5) achieved the **Honorable Mention** at this year’s competition!

**Sustainable Lifestyle Challenge – Second Place And Merit Award**

Nine teams of students took part in the Sustainable Lifestyle Challenge, jointly organised by the Institute of Technical Education, National Environment Agency, South-East CDC and supported by Ascendas-Singbridge Gives Foundation. Two of the teams achieved the **Second Place** in the Secondary Category and a **Merit Award** respectively. The competition aims to create awareness on climate issues and engage the students in consciously reducing waste generated through a changed lifestyle, based on the theme of “Creating a Sustainable Lifestyle in our Living Environment”.  The students worked on their projects over 3 months, mentored by teachers from the Science Department, Project Work Committee and Environment Club. They developed innovative solutions to reduce food, energy, water and other waste, conducted surveys and produced a written report and video on their prototypes. One team was selected to present their projects to a panel of judges in the finals held on 7th September.

# Ngee Ann Polytechnic Science and Technology Challenge – Take Flight & Soar! 2018 – Most Innovative

On 4th Sep, a team of Aeronautics Club members with the help of a parent volunteer took part in the "Take Flight and Soar" category of the NYP Science and Technology Challenge. As part of the competition, the team had to build a rubber-band powered aircraft prototype to compete for the longest flight time in a circular flying path.  Despite facing stiff competition from 15 other participating schools, our team clinched the **Most Innovative Award**!

 Working with a given set of materials and a time limit of 4 hours, our North Stars proved that they were able to work collaboratively under pressure to produce a unique prototype, as ours was the best aesthetically-designed plane, and the only one with the canard wing design, which is an aeronautical arrangement where a small forewing is placed in front of the main wings, typically seen on fighter planes, that contributes to upward lift and reduces overall drag.  Our team were also able to think out of the box and attached the propeller provided to the back of the plane in reverse orientation so that it produced a push force rather than the conventional pull force that is exerted when it is located at the front of the plane.
