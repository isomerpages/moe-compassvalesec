# Achievements in Science Competitions 2018

As part of our school efforts to develop our strengths in teaching and learning of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math), the Science Department has strived to imbue a passion for science and innovation in our students.  Students who show a keen interest and aptitude for Science are given the opportunity to participate in external competitions where they are involved in real-world problem solving through scientific investigations under the mentorship of their Science teachers. Our students have done us proud by their recent achievements in various national-level Science competitions in Semester two.

**Singapore Youth Science Fair – Two Distinction Awards**

On 25th July, two teams of North Stars participated in the Singapore Youth Science Fair (SYSF) and both clinched the highest honour of **Distinction Award** in the Lower Secondary Category.   The science fair is an annual scientific research competition co-organized by the Science Teachers Association of Singapore and Science Centre Singapore to promote scientific study through investigation, encourage creativity and innovation through problem-solving and heighten awareness of scientific research and technology development.  The two teams worked on their project over the span of three months. The first team investigated the efficacy of certain home-based extraction methods of common herbs as antimicrobial agents, while the second group investigated the effectiveness of a modified Eco-cooler in lowering the temperature of ambient air. This culminated in the teams writing a report and designing a poster to summarize their findings and producing a 5-minute video presentation to present their results.

# Ngee Ann Polytechnic Science and Technology Challenge – Take Flight & Soar! 2018 – Most Innovative

On 4th Sep, a team of Aeronautics Club members with the help of a parent volunteer took part in the "Take Flight and Soar" category of the NYP Science and Technology Challenge. As part of the competition, the team had to build a rubber-band powered aircraft prototype to compete for the longest flight time in a circular flying path.  Despite facing stiff competition from 15 other participating schools, our team clinched the **Most Innovative Award**!

 Working with a given set of materials and a time limit of 4 hours, our North Stars proved that they were able to work collaboratively under pressure to produce a unique prototype, as ours was the best aesthetically-designed plane, and the only one with the canard wing design, which is an aeronautical arrangement where a small forewing is placed in front of the main wings, typically seen on fighter planes, that contributes to upward lift and reduces overall drag.  Our team were also able to think out of the box and attached the propeller provided to the back of the plane in reverse orientation so that it produced a push force rather than the conventional pull force that is exerted when it is located at the front of the plane.

# National Chinese Mobile App Development by Student for Student Competition 2018–Two Excellence Award

Two teams of our students participated in the 2018 National Chinese Mobile App Development by Student for Student Competition 2018 （全国学生华文手机应用程序制作比赛）and won two Excellence Awards. The competition was organised by the Singapore Centre for Chinese Language and sponsored by Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism, and was the first Chinese Language App programming competition for students across the country from all secondary schools, ITE and Junior Colleges. More than 400 students in 94 teams participated in this competition where they were required to develop apps for pre-school children and lower primary students.

Despite facing stiff competitions from schools with strong computing background like HCI, NUS High School of Mathematics and Science and SAP schools like Dunman High School, both our Lower and Upper Secondary teams have done our school proud by clinching two spots in the Top 20.  The teams started planning and designing the app from November 2017 and submitted the final mock-up app in April this year.  As our students have no prior experience in coding using the app Thunkable, all of them had to learn coding from scratch and explored how to code and design the games with the assistance of the professionals. Both of their apps will be further developed by the professionals into a full app downloadable from Apple Store and Google Play.  The apps could be downloadable from the link: [https://appcompetition.tk.sg/download/](https://appcompetition.tk.sg/download/)

# LLP – Sec 3 Service Learning Projects 2018
  
As part of our “Learning for Life Programme” (LLP) on Community and Youth Leadership, all Sec 3 students had to plan and execute a class–initiated VIA service learning project in partnership with Ling Kwang Home, Brighthill Evergreen Home and Sunlove Home.

To empower the students to take ownership and carry out their projects to meet the needs of the homes, all the students attended a Service Learning Workshop to equip them with the necessary knowledge, competencies and leadership skills. Students carried out personal reflections after each training session to better understand the importance of being a socially responsible member of the community.  

 The projects were successfully carried out and brought warmth and smiles to each and every of the residents at the homes. Our students engaged the residents with activities and games such as bingo, “a minute to win it” and collaborative art and craft projects. Some classes came up with sing-along sessions and dance performances while others chose to accompany the residents on an outing to places like Gardens by the Bay. At the end of their projects, student representatives from each class shared with their peers and juniors (Sec 3 and 2 students), on their experience and learning points.

# CVSS Green Compass Programme

Our Green Compass Programme is a level wide programme for all Sec 1 and 2 students to learn about environmental conservation and play an active part in our nation’s drive towards creating a greener environment for everyone.

In partnership with the National Environment Agency (NEA), Sec 1 students learn about the various ways that our country handles waste management such as the Semakau Landfill & the 3Rs and the importance of food waste management as well.  The highlight of the programme is our annual recyclables collection drive in collaboration with Sembcorp. This year, our Sec 1s covered 37 HDB blocks in the neighbourhood. Prior to the collection, they distributed leaflets and talked to residents about the purpose of this collection drive and encouraged them to adopt green values and habits in their daily lives.
