# CVSS Alumni Homecoming 2018 – Reminiscing the Good Old Days!
Our second CVSS Alumni Homecoming Day – “Reminiscing the Good Old Days!” was successfully held on 30 Jun 2018. Alumni across 17 batches gathered to reminisce their secondary school days as they participated in various activities planned by the CVSS Alumni EXCO.  The highlight of the event was the Captain’s Ball Friendly Match, which attracted a total of 8 teams!  The team consisting of Darren Ngoh, Choo Zhi Xuan, Ryan Lim, Lim Xuan Cheng, Tristan Wee and Glenn Tan (Class of 2016) successfully defended their title and emerged champions once again!

Ms Fara Lisa (Class of 2010), who is an Art teacher in CVSS now, conducted a Basic Watercolour Painting Workshop for our alumni where they tried their hands at basic floral and fruits painting! Our musically talented alumni also put up live performances to much applause from the audience.

Our Sec 3 student buddies hosted Xinggang students with much warmth and hospitality. The Xinggang students attended a special Design & Technology (D&T) lesson conducted by our Senior Teacher for D&T where they tried polishing acrylic using sand paper and were introduced to 3D printer.  They also attended a special art-music lesson conducted by our Subject Head for Aesthetics and art teachers where they were introduced to synaesthesia art which requires them to visualise and create their favourite songs in terms of lines and colours using ice cream sticks.

The school also coincided the hosting with our commemoration of Racial Harmony Day.  It was an eye-opener for Xinggang students as they had the opportunity to try henna and our local traditional food and games.

Our Sec 2 student buddies also hosted the Changshu students with equal zest and enthusiasm.  The Changshu students attended a special Food & Consumer Education (FCE) lesson conducted by our Senior Teacher for Food and Nutrition where they tried their hands on baking crispy honey flakes cookies. This is a modern snack made by both Malays and Chinese during Hari Raya Puasa and Chinese New Year respectively.

The students also attended a special Music class conducted by our Subject Head for Aesthetics and music teacher where they were introduced to the concept of a common pop chord progression and learnt basic improvisation skills. Students had to spontaneously create a melody over it, and finished it off by layering a rhythmic accompaniment. ICT was also infused in the lesson through creating a backing track using a looping app.

A simple farewell was organised for both schools whereby student representatives from both our school and Xinggang/Changshu shared their learning experiences and exchanged friendship gifts. The students were also highly engaged through a general knowledge quiz on Singapore and China, with much fun and laughter.

The hosting ended with a sumptuous farewell lunch for all the students and teachers from Xinggang and Changshu and our student buddies and teachers accompanying our guests in a visit to the Arts Science Museum. Everyone had an exciting time experiencing three high-tech interactive artworks and exhibitions: Future World – Where Art Meets Science, Wind Walkers: Theo Jansen’s Strandbeests and Marvel Studios: Ten Years of Heroes. All in all, the hosting was a memorable experience for our North Stars as they got to mingle and make new friends from our twinning schools. They also got to speak and use the Chinese Language more through the hosting. It was another year for us to sustain and strengthen our friendships with the two twinning schools.
