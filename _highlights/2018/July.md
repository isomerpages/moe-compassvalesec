# OVERSEAS SERVICE LEARNING PROGRAMME TO HO CHI MINH CITY, VIETNAM 2018
36 student leaders and 5 teachers went on our annual Overseas Service Learning Programme (OSLP) to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam from 2 to 8 June 2018.  As part of our Learning for Life Programme, the OSLP aims to develop community and youth leadership in our students through values-in-action projects with an overseas partner school. The OSLP also develops in students the 21st century competencies of global awareness, cross-cultural skills and sensitivities, sensitise them to the place of Singapore in ASEAN and strengthen their commitment and rootedness to Singapore.

Our partner school this year was Tran Van On Primary School. Over 3 full days, our student leaders conducted art & craft, English and Mathematics lessons for the pupils, played simple sports and games with them, and taught them to sing our favourite national day song – Home, in English, Chinese and Malay Languages.

To ensure our students serve the community to the best of their ability, our students and teachers spent 2 weeks to prepare for the trip.  Under the guidance of teachers, students were given the autonomy to decide what they wished to do to meet the community needs, leveraging their strengths and abilities.  Students worked together independently as a team to pre-empt potential problems. One issue raised was language barrier in lesson delivery. To overcome this, students translated key words that they would likely use into Vietnamese and learnt to pronounce these words.

Our students also helped out in the physical refurbishment of the school. In a short span of 2 and a half days, they gave the school a fresh coat of paint, and decorated the exterior walls with colourful murals.

The service with Tran Van On Primary School ended with a farewell performance by our students followed by gifts exchange. The School leaders of Tran Van On Primary School thanked us for the help rendered and welcomed our school to visit them again in future.

After 3 days of hard work, our students went on an eco-tourism tour visiting local coconut candy production factory, bee farm factories and agricultural farms.  They were treated to fresh and delicious local fruits, honey water and a live performance of Vietnamese songs played with traditional Vietnamese musical instruments. Students also developed a deeper appreciation for the tough life of the farmers, as they tried planting curry leaves and harvesting tapioca under the hot sun with their bare hands.

To know more about the history of Vietnam, students visited the Cu Chi Tunnel in the Vietnam War.  During the guided tour, students learnt about how Vietnamese soldiers survived the wars with innovation, creativity and adaptability, as well as grit, courage and care for their fellow people. Students also visited an orphanage in the Cu Chi Village, which is self-funded and takes in abandoned children, able-bodied or with special needs. Through the interaction with the orphans, our students were acutely aware of how fortunate they are.

To appreciate Vietnamese Arts and Aesthetics, students watched a water puppet show and tried their hands on lacquer making and Vietnamese glutinous rice wrapping.

To remember the trip and the lessons that they have learnt, our students wrote a postcard to themselves and mail it to Singapore at the Saigon Central Post Office.  Everyone returned to Singapore with fresh perspectives, a stronger heart for the less fortunate, deeper appreciation for the comfort, peace and orderliness in Singapore, a closer and special bond with one another in the team as well as many stories to share with their schoolmates and families.  It was no doubt a most meaningful and fruitful trip for all students and teachers.

Focusing on the theme of **_‘Take Responsibility’_,** the Sec 2s visited the Energy Efficiency Centre and Shell Singapore ‘Make the Future Festival’ under our Science Outdoor Learning Experience (SOLE) programme to learn about energy conservation. They also attended talks and worked on various upcycling projects to demonstrate how they can act responsibly towards the community and the environment. In addition, the students also visited the Old Ford Factory, Changi Museum and Kranji Memorial to better appreciate Singapore’s history during the Japanese Occupation and their responsibility for our nation defence.

With the theme of **_‘Adopting An Enterprising Spirit’_**, the Sec 3s went through a 3 day 2 night outdoor adventure camp at the PA-Water Venture (Sembawang) campsite. The students developed resilience and ruggedness through various challenging activities such as kayaking, raft-building, navigation and a night walk.

**_‘Ready For The World’_** was the theme for our Sec 4s and 5s as they took part in activities designed to help them understand their strengths and learning styles, develop their personal brands and hone their interview skills to prepare them for life after secondary school. They also visited post-secondary institutions to learn more about their courses and options. The programme culminated in a learning carnival known as _The Ninja Warriors_ where they piqued their skills with their peers by tapping on their strengths, problem solving skills and teamwork.

The school presented plaques for MOE Edusave Character Awardees who have received their monetary awards at community centres earlier in the year to further emphasize the importance of character development.   Service Awards were presented to student leaders who have served in the Student Council or their respective CCA with dedication and distinction.  Mr Lee Kang Hwa, our SAC Chairman, also presented the Lee Kang Hwa Gratitude Award to six recipients this year. This award was instituted by Mr Lee since 2011 to express his gratitude towards society at large for his success in life. It is given to students who have strived for success and made commendable efforts under challenging circumstances. It is hoped that they would in turn pay it forward to society for the help and recognition received when they achieve success in life in future.

Interspersed between the speeches and awards segments were musical interludes performed by our North Stars and CVSS Alumni. Tay Juen Jie (4E3) and Matthew Jamero (4N2) put up a piano performance titled "The Climb" which talks about the importance of never giving up no matter how difficult the challenges are ahead of us.  It also speaks of their struggles in learning the piano on their own since young.  As a tradition, our former students also took part in the performances.  Joseph Rien, Joelle Lee, Sabrina Foo and Yeo Qi performed a clarinet piece of the song, “When You are Old” to remind our North Stars about filial piety and showing care and concern to their aging parents as they grow older.  It was a commendable effort for them to find the time to gather and practise the song together.

The Drama members doubled up as emcees, and told a story, weaved together with the pieces performed by Dance, Choir and Band, including the song “Tegami, Letter to My 15 Year Old Self” sung by our Choir to encourage our students to stay positive. The concert ended with a grand finale involving everyone singing our School Song with pride and sense of belonging.

As part of the Anniversary & Awards Day, we also showcased our school programmes with a mini-exhibition based on our North Star’s Pledge and what our students can expect to go through as they live out the pledge of “I will learn and find my compass; I will excel and strive to go far; I will grow and live a life of purpose; I will shine as I am a North Star”.   Our Student Ambassadors confidently brought the GOH and guests through the exhibits.  Aeronautics Club members also showed off what they learnt in our Aeronautics Applied Learning Programme and wowed the VIP entourage and guests with their “flying” skills using the model planes they designed and built. Using a 3D radio-controlled plane, Koh Tze Wang (1E2) demonstrated stunts such as Hover, Harrier and Harrier Roll etc within the confined space in the canteen.

Happy anniversary, CVSS!
