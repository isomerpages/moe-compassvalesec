# 2018 Create Your Own Newspaper Competition

A total of 79 schools participated in the 2018 National Create Your Own Newspaper Competition （2018年全国编采比赛）organised by The Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning, SPH Zbcomma and Xinmin Secondary School.  Despite facing stiff competition from schools such as Hwa Chong Institution, Nanyang Girls' High, Catholic High School and CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School, our North Stars have done us very proud by clinching the **First Position and Most Popular Award** in the **Lower Secondary Category**, and the **Second Position** in the **Upper Secondary Category**. This is the **best**results our school has achieved in the six years that we have participated in this competition. We were featured in the report on the competition in Zbcomma.

In the competition, participants were required to interview, take pictures as well as design the layout of the news article using Adobe Indesign.  Our lower secondary students interviewed the “heroes” (security guard, landscape technician and high-rise cleaner) behind our city’s cleanliness and safety, while the upper secondary students interviewed young “hawkerpreneurs” and learnt about their struggles in running their own stalls.  All submissions were judged based on content (40%), layout (40%) and language expression (20%).

# National Schools Literature Festival 2018

On 21 July, two teams of North Stars did the school proud at the 2018 National Schools Literature Festival (NSLF) by clinching **1st place in the Book Trailer segment and joint 2nd place in the Choral Speaking segment**. 

Organised annually by a committee of Literature teachers with support from NIE, CPDD and the National Arts Council, a key objective of the NSLF is to provide a platform to enthuse and inspire students in the learning of Literature. This year there were 103 schools participating in the festival, competing in a range of activities which enabled students to demonstrate understanding and appreciation of literary texts including novels, poems and drama texts.

 The **Book Trailer segment** of the competition requires teams to interpret and craft a trailer for a chosen text, giving enough information about the plot, main characters and its themes such that the audience would be enticed to read the book after the performance.  Our Book Trailer team comprised the following Sec 2 students: Yuki Justin Goh Jun Jie (2E1), Vishal Chaudhari (2E2), Wong Yi Xuan Beatrice (2E3), Koh Yi Quan, Lim Wei Suen, Shermaine Tan Rui En, Tan Jin Ying, Teow Kai Xin Esther and Lim Kun Yan, Markus (above all from 2E5).

This year, our school also took part in the **Choral Speaking segment** for the first time. This involves an ensemble using various voice combinations and contrasts to bring out the meaning and tonal beauty of a passage of poetry or prose. Our team came in joint 2nd place with Cedar Girls' Secondary and comprised the following Sec 1 students: Syeda Aliza Nadir, Seetoh Tong En, Zeenshah Qaiser, Lutfil Hadi, Sneha Menon (above all from 1E2), Azza Zafrin, Kirsten Alessandra Romero Munoz, Kristine Eriel Peren Velasco, Ng Yong Cheng Kenrich (above all from 1E4), Intan Insyira and Rini Syaqilah (both from 1N2).

A key takeaway was seeing the students emerge from the experience feeling enriched, inspired and heartened that their months of training had borne fruit. Throughout the event, they also displayed a great amount of resilience, teamwork and sportsmanship. Their exemplary attitude and values indeed exemplify our North Star spirit.
