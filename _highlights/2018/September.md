# 2018 Create Your Own Newspaper Competition

A total of 79 schools participated in the 2018 National Create Your Own Newspaper Competition （2018年全国编采比赛）organised by The Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning, SPH Zbcomma and Xinmin Secondary School.  Despite facing stiff competition from schools such as Hwa Chong Institution, Nanyang Girls' High, Catholic High School and CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School, our North Stars have done us very proud by clinching the **First Position and Most Popular Award** in the **Lower Secondary Category**, and the **Second Position** in the **Upper Secondary Category**. This is the **best**results our school has achieved in the six years that we have participated in this competition. We were featured in the report on the competition in Zbcomma.

In the competition, participants were required to interview, take pictures as well as design the layout of the news article using Adobe Indesign.  Our lower secondary students interviewed the “heroes” (security guard, landscape technician and high-rise cleaner) behind our city’s cleanliness and safety, while the upper secondary students interviewed young “hawkerpreneurs” and learnt about their struggles in running their own stalls.  All submissions were judged based on content (40%), layout (40%) and language expression (20%).
