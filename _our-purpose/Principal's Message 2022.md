**Reflections on 2021**

2021 has been another year of living with Covid-19 and adapting our school programmes in alignment with the prevailing safe management/ring fencing measures and MOE guidelines for school activities. I am heartened that our students have coped well with the “new normal” of learning such as personalised digital learning programme with personal learning devices and blended learning with home-based online learning and student-initiated learning.There was greater reliance on technology and self-directed independent learning, and students needed to acquire new study skills and learn new media literacies. On the other hand, there were fewer social interactions due to limitations of class-based/cohortised activities and social distancing. The missed opportunities of making friends and learning beyond class/level/school and social events in school had impacted on the social skills development of our students.

In view of the added stress and anxiety due to additional demands in academic studies and limited social emotional development, we have paid close attention to the well being of students, in particular mental health, through termly back to school programme, form teachers’ engagement with form classes, peer support system and various pastoral care programmes for all students, especially high needs students.  

Nevertheless, although there were many lost opportunities of learning experiences, there were also many life lessons that our students could learn from the pandemic. The current cohorts of students will form part of the “Covid Generation” who would have developed more resilience and adaptability for a VUCA [Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, Ambiguous] world.

As for the staff, I am grateful that all our teachers have continued their best efforts in ensuring quality teaching and learning and providing our students as many opportunities as possible for holistic development and a quality school learning experience despite the various restrictions and disruptions due to Covid.  To help our staff cope with the additional teaching/work demands and administrative tasks, we have spent much effort in ensuring adequate staffing, optimising staff deployment/workload, prioritising school programmes, and organising staff developmental and well-being programmes.

**Focus Areas in 2022**

Our school programmes are aligned to MOE’s focus areas of learn for life, embracing all learners and enhancing student well-being.

  
**Learn for Life**

“Achieve our Best” and “Believe in Ourselves” is part of our school ethos.  To encourage our students to learn for life, we nurture joy of learning in our students, and develop in them 21st century competencies holistically, anchored on sound values, so as to be world- and future-ready.  This is achieved through the following programmes:

* Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Programme for all students – Personal Education and Career Plan/aspirational target setting, Advanced Elective Modules for all Sec 3 Express/NA students and ITE Elective Modules for all Sec 3 NT students, facilitation for  direct/early admission to JCs, polytechnics and ITE.

* Instructional Programmes based on CVSS i-Teach Framework for integrated, engaged and assessed learning with teachers as curriculum innovators, collaborative learners and holistic educators. School-wide pedagogies include Assessment for Learning, Making Thinking Visible, Whole School Approach to Effective Communications etc.

* Signature departmental programmes (eg. Science Pri.IDE (promising idea) Challenge, Science Outdoor Learning Experience (SOLE),A\*Star Scientist in School programme, Math Challenge Programme, D&T Makers Faire Programme, ICT Digital Maker Programme, English Language/Mother Tongue Oracy Skills Programme), together with at least one enrichment programme per level/stream by each department and at least 30% of each cohort participating in external competitions to challenge students to learn beyond the textbooks. 

* Aeronautics Applied Learning Programme and “O” level Electronics applied subject to link learning to applications in the real world

* Inter-disciplinary Project Work with a scientific focus on environment education/sustainable living to   develop creative & critical thinking and collaborative problem-solving skills. 

* ACE (Academic Excellence) Programme based on PRIME (PRoaction, Intervention, Motivation & Empowerment)   framework to achieve  value-added academic performance. This includes ASPIRE motivational programme and   After School Remediation Programme for all graduating students, “Team 12” to help Sec 4NA students to qualify for Polytechnic Foundational Programme etc.

* Blended learning/Personalised Digital Learning Programme since Semester 2/2021 to accelerate learning   through digital tools and prepare students to thrive in a digital and technology-driven future.  This   includes Student-Initiated Learning during the regular Home-based Learning (HBL) days to encourage   students to pursue their passion and interest, and nurture self-directed learners.  In 2022, we have added fortnightly “Techy Thursday” for students to learn New Media Literacy skills through bite-size learning packages

* MOE’s refreshed CCE (Character & Citizenship Education) curriculum to equip students with stronger   sense of values, resilience and    skills with greater emphasis on mental health, contemporary issues and   peer support, supported by our weekly “Wisdom Wednesday” for CCE structured reading programme.    

* G2R3IT programme to promote our school values of G2R3IT (Graciousness, Gratitude, Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Teamwork)

* CVSS CAReS \[Care in Action, Ready to Serve\] Values-in-Action Programme, Learning for Life Programme on   Community & Youth Leadership \[Inspired North Stars Inspire Actions\] and Environment Education Programme (Green Compass Programme/Environment Club) to nurture concerned global citizens who cares   for the community and the environment.

* STAR holistic student development programme for all students – Seek out your strength, Take   responsibility, Adopt an enterprising spirit and Ready for the world. Special normal course programmes for NA/NT students to cater to their specific needs.  

* Student voice and advocacy to nurture active contributors (Leadership Development Programme, student councillors/class leaders, CCA leaders, CCE/Cyber Wellness Ambassadors, VIA/Environment Champions)  

* CCA (Co-Curricular Activities) – A total of 20 CCA (5 uniformed groups, 4 performing arts, 5 sports   and 6 clubs & societies) for students to discover their interests and develop their talents. Through   CCA, students develop their character, learn values, social emotional competencies and skills to   prepare them for future challenges.  CCA also bring students from diverse backgrounds together.  By   learning and interacting with one another, students develop friendships and deepen their sense of belonging to the school and community.

  

**Enhancing Student Well-being**

“Care for One Another” is part of our school ethos. Through social emotional profiling exercise and termly “check-in” surveys, we have identified the top 3 needs of our students as resilience and well-being, civic-mindedness and level-specific social-emotional skills. To meet these needs, we have focused on the following:

* Nurturing a Resilience Mindset – Nurturing a growth mindset/positive thinking through Positive Education based on PERMA framework (Positive Emotion, Engagement, Positive Relationships, Meaniing, Achievements) infused into various school programmes. To reinforce this, we have introduced weekly “Mindful Monday” and “Felicitous Friday”. On “Mindful Mondays”, students start the week with simple mindfulness exercise facilitated by their Form Teachers who have all been trained in mindfulness practices. We hope to develop in students the discipline of having quiet moments to gain greater awareness of their mental state, focus on the present and    things that matter and start the week on a positive note.  On “Felicitous Fridays”, students recount their experiences for the week, be      grateful for even the little things, and look forward to the following week with rigour and optimisim.

* Developing Cognitive, Social and Emotional Skills – Teaching students skills such as adaptability, problem-solving and emotional regulation explicitly through STAR Programme, CCE lessons, Peer Support & Relationships Programme, CCA etc. 

* Providing a Caring & Enabling Environment – To develop positive Teacher-Student Relationship and strengthen teacher-student bonding, we have instituted regular one-on-one Teacher-Student Chat (TSC) for Form/Co-Form teachers to know their students better    where every student will be engaged at least twice a year.  From 2022, we have set aside “Tender Tuesday” for this purpose. We hope students will feel valued, cared for and supported by their teachers. We have also implemented Peer Support & Relationships (TSR) Programme since 2017, with 2 Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) in each class to build positive student-student relationship, and have shared our best practices at MOE’s platforms. In 2022, we will provide broader and deeper training for all PSLs and enhance the roles    of Peer Support Student Mentors.

  

**Looking Ahead**
	
Covid-19 has disrupted many of our key school events/programmes in the past 2 years. We hope we could resume our annual cross- country race/sports carnival, Anniversary & Awards Day, Graduation Night and our many overseas trips (China Suzhou twinning schools exchange/performing arts/cultural immersion, Japan aeronautics learning journeys, Indonesia Bandung adventure and leadership development, Vietnam service-learning community projects, Thailand Boys Brigade Exchange) soon.  We have also cancelled our 20th school anniversary celebrations in 2020 due to Covid and eagerly look forward to our silver jubilee in 2025. 

  

Our long-term goal remains one to realise our school vision of developing our students to be ‘World Ready Youth’ (and future ready for a constantly changing world) through a forward looking, balanced and holistic education, a vibrant learning community with a caring culture, and close collaborations with our parents, stakeholders and partners.  To establish a niche of excellence in teaching and learning, we will continue to develop our strengths in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math), infusing design thinking, maker space and computational thinking in Science, Math, Design & Technology and Infocomm Technology.
  
A school is only as good as its teachers.  We place a strong emphasis on continual staff professional development and have a strong team of School Staff Developer and Lead/Senior Teachers to constantly improve the quality of teaching and learning and to promote a strong professional learning and innovative culture among all teachers.  Our teachers regularly share their expertise at various platforms beyond the school such as MOE ExCEL Fest/Teachers Conference and AST Teacher-Led Workshops.  We have consistently achieved MOE Innergy Awards for innovations in teaching and learning.  Our teachers have also won several national recognition in the past few years such as President Award for Teachers, finalists in Outstanding Youth in Education Awards, NIE Caring Teacher Award (national level), Association of AST Awards and appointments to the Teachers Council chaired by Director-General of Education.

Our students recite the North Stars’ Pledge every Monday during flag-raising ceremony: “I will learn and find my compass; I will excel and strive to go far; I will grow and live a life of purpose; I will shine as I am a North Star!”  At the end of the week, students will reflect on what they have learnt and achieved, and how have they lived and shined like a North Star in the course of the week. Being and becoming a North Star is an ongoing journey of personal growth for all our students to find their compass and realise the star within, and all our teachers are committed to help our students realise this goal and bring out the best in everyone.
