<strong>Reflections on 2021 </strong>

2021 has been another year of living with Covid-19 and adapting our school programmes in alignment with the prevailing safe management/ring fencing measures and MOE guidelines for school activities. I am heartened that our students have coped well with the “new normal” of learning such as personalised digital learning programme with personal learning devices and blended learning with home-based online learning and student-initiated learning.There was greater reliance on technology and self-directed independent learning, and students needed to acquire new study skills and learn new media literacies. On the other hand, there were fewer social interactions due to limitations of class-based/cohortised activities and social distancing. The missed opportunities of making friends and learning beyond class/level/school and social events in school had impacted on the social skills development of our students.

  

  

In view of the added stress and anxiety due to additional demands in academic studies and limited social emotional development, we have paid close attention to the well being of students, in particular mental health, through termly back to school programme, form teachers’ engagement with form classes, peer support system and various pastoral care programmes for all students, especially high needs students.  

  

Nevertheless, although there were many lost opportunities of learning experiences, there were also many life lessons that our students could learn from the pandemic. The current cohorts of students will form part of the “Covid Generation” who would have developed more resilience and adaptability for a VUCA \[Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, Ambiguous\] world.

  

As for the staff, I am grateful that all our teachers have continued their best efforts in ensuring quality teaching and learning and providing our students as many opportunities as possible for holistic development and a quality school learning experience despite the various restrictions and disruptions due to Covid.  To help our staff cope with the additional teaching/work demands and administrative tasks, we have spent much effort in ensuring adequate staffing, optimising staff deployment/workload, prioritising school programmes, and organising staff developmental and well-being programmes.
