### Discipline Background

Discipline is an integral part of schooling in Compassvale Secondary School. We believe that discipline forms the bedrock of a student’s development and growth. Only with good discipline will there be effective teaching and learning. The discipline policy in CVSS is, “Every teacher is a discipline teacher and every youth matters”. We aim to nurture our students into self disciplined youths through the inculcation of values, social and emotional competencies.

### General Conduct

*   Proper decorum should be maintained at all times.
