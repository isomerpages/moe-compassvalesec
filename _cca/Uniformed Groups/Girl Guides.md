At CVSS, we empower our Guides through enjoyable, educational and challenging programmes to discover and develop their strengths. Our Five-Point Programme aims to help our Guides develop leadership and life skills in five key areas: Personal & Social Development, Outdoors, Home, Community and International. The skill sets that they attain help them to thrive in the ever-changing demands of the world.  

#### Accomplishments in 2021

The unit’s goals include a variety of activities to enrich the experiences of our Guides using the non-formal educational method adopted by the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS).   

Our Guides faced this year with resilience and demonstrated their ability to adapt and rise to the challenge of e-learning. They completed modules on GuidingLight, an e-learning platform to continue learning despite not being able to meet for CCA sessions. Guides achieved various proficiency badges such as SANA, Smart Surf, Crime Prevention via self-directed learning and/or video conferencing in addition to activities planned and executed by teachers.
