At CVSS, we empower our Guides through enjoyable, educational and challenging programmes to discover and develop their strengths. Our Five-Point Programme aims to help our Guides develop leadership and life skills in five key areas: Personal & Social Development, Outdoors, Home, Community and International. The skill sets that they attain help them to thrive in the ever-changing demands of the world.  

#### Accomplishments in 2021

The unit’s goals include a variety of activities to enrich the experiences of our Guides using the non-formal educational method adopted by the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS).   

Our Guides faced this year with resilience and demonstrated their ability to adapt and rise to the challenge of e-learning. They completed modules on GuidingLight, an e-learning platform to continue learning despite not being able to meet for CCA sessions. Guides achieved various proficiency badges such as SANA, Smart Surf, Crime Prevention via self-directed learning and/or video conferencing in addition to activities planned and executed by teachers.

In recognition of our efforts, our Company has been awarded the Puan Noor Aisha Gold Award in 2017, 2018 and 2019. This award is an affirmation of our hard work and dedication in the various events, initiatives and programmes that we have planned and participated in in recent years. 

#### Aspirations

CVSS Girl Guides aspire to empower girls to realise their potential by providing opportunities in leading themselves and others. The girls would learn life skills – such as personal goal-setting, decision-making and team-building in a safe and supported environment. Guides build and strengthen their leadership skills by taking the lead in Unit and Patrol activities, learning to organise events, and teaching each other and younger girls new skills.

At CVSS, we empower our Guides through enjoyable, educational and challenging programmes to discover and develop their strengths.

The skill sets that they attain help them to thrive in the ever-changing demands of the world.

### What we accomplished in 2020

The unit’s goals include a variety of activities to enrich the experiences of our Guides using the non-formal educational method adopted by the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS). The intended activities include ‘Level 1 Rock Climbing and Baking’ courses.

Though we did not carry out a few intended activities due to Ccccovis-19, our Guides faced this unexpected disruption with resilience and demonstrated their ability to adapt and rise to the challenge of e-learning. They completed modules on GuidingLight, an e-learning platform to continue learning despite not being able to meet for CCA sessions. Sec 3 Guides completed the SANA badge and the Sec 1 Guides completed the Singapore Kindness (Bronze) badge. These were completed via self-directed learning and/or video conferencing.

In recognition of our efforts, our Company has been awarded the Puan Noor Aisha Gold Award in 2017, 2018 and 2019. This award is an affirmation of our hard work and dedication in the various events, initiatives and programmes that we have planned and participated in in recent years. 

Ms Jenny Shea Ka Yen was awarded the Clover Award for her contributions which enabled Girl Guides Singapore to serve the mission of developing girls and young women in Singapore to realise their potential.

#### Reaching out to the community

The Sec 1 Guides also embarked on the Singapore Kindness (Gold) badge challenge organised by the Singapore Kindness Movement. Through this project, the Guides advocated good online etiquette and safe use of the Internet. They set up an Instagram account with the title @abcdeforetiquette, designed a mascot and characters, and illustrated short stories of the characters interacting with each other. Each story conveyed messages related to online etiquette and the stories were posted on Instagram. The stories aimed to promote respect in the cyberspace and advise the target audience, consisting mainly of their peers, against cyberbullying. Each Instagram post was also accompanied by a caption providing tips on how to have a good online etiquette and navigate the cyberspace safely.
