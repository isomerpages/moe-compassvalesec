The CVSS NPCC Unit engages students in a stringent but enjoyable programme every year. The key thrusts of the unit’s training framework are character and leadership development. Cadets will develop useful qualities such as resilience, tenacity, confidence and perseverance through drills, training sessions and programmes.   

  

#### Accomplishments  

Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, several NPCC activities had to be cancelled or postponed indefinitely. Despite this, our cadets displayed  the value of resilience by finding new and innovative ways to conduct their training sessions according to the NPCC syllabus. For example, our new Secondary One cadets had their swearing-in ceremony via a Zoom session with cadets from six other schools in our area. During the ceremony, we invited speakers from the Singapore Police Force to share their experiences with the cadets. In addition, several other core courses were also conducted through Zoom. Cadets also attended courses on Police Knowledge, Road Safety Training, Crime Prevention as well as Leadership and Mentoring. These courses helped to build our cadets’ character and instilled in them the core values espoused by NPCC, equipping them with knowledge of Singapore’s modern security needs. One innovative way in which the cadets tried to bring their training online was through the use of filming of foot drills and commands and uploading the videos online for the rest of the cadets to view and learn at their own time. 

In addition, our Secondary Three cadets also had the opportunity to fire the .22 calibre revolvers as part of their marksmanship training. The Secondary One cadets also had the opportunity to try out the air pistol through an enrichment programme, while the Secondary Two cadets went through a full two-day Standard First Aid Course.

### What we accomplished in 2020

Due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, several NPCC activities had to be cancelled or postponed indefinitely. Despite this, our cadets managed to display the value of resilience by finding new and innovative ways to conduct their trainings according to the NPCC syllabus. For example, our new secondary one cadets had their Swearing In ceremony live via Zoom with cadets from 6 other schools in our Area. During the Swearing In Ceremony, we invited speakers from the Singapore Police Force to share their experiences with the cadets. 

  

In addition, several other core courses were also conducted through Zoom. Cadets also attended courses in Police Knowledge, Road Safety Training, Crime Prevention as well as Leadership and Mentoring. These courses help to build our cadets’ character, instilling in them the core values espoused by NPCC and equipping them with important knowledge of Singapore’s modern security needs. One innovative way in which the cadets tried to bring their training online was through the use of filming of foot drills and commands and uploading the videos online for the rest of the cadets to view and learn at their own time. 

  

Despite the challenges that 2020 had brought, CVSS NPCC is determined to continue to find new and innovative ways to ensure that all our cadets fulfil and develop to their full potential.
