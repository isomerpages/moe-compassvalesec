CVSS Boys’ Brigade is a CCA that focuses on the development of the youth. Its mission is to nurture youth, based on sound values, to lead and serve.

With a team of committed teachers, officers and boy leaders, the Boys’ Brigade has consistently contributed to the school’s MOE Award of SSA-UG (Sustained Achievement Award - Uniformed Groups) for the past decade with our strong track record in the annual JM Fraser Award for Unit Excellence awarded by BBHQ. For the assessment period of 2019/2020, our BB unit achieved the Gold Award which is the highest accolade for BB Companies in Singapore.

#### Programmes

The Boys’ Brigade’s innovative and customised integrated 4-year programme consists of activities and events either organised internally or externally with BBHQ. Our programmes aim to build confidence for leadership and service amongst our boys. Due to the COVID-19 situation this year, we came up with new programmes to engage our boys meaningfully. Some of these programmes are e-CCA sessions over ZOOM and in-house enrichment such as musketry, archery and first aid training within the school compounds.&nbsp;

In preparation for our BB Company’s 20th Anniversary, which is a significant milestone for us, we started planning early in the year some activities to commemorate the occasion. This includes having a ceremonial parade for our Colours (Company Flag) Consecration Service. The special occasion was marked with a hybrid event on 17 Dec 2021 whereby some of our main stakeholders such parents, alumni (ex-captains, officers, teachers and old Boys), current teachers and officers, BBHQ representatives plus sponsoring church members can participate in person while our current boys participated online in view of the SMM measures. The physical presence of some participants at the event at the church compounds in St Andrew's Village along with keynote speeches, live bagpipes and Colours march-in helped to lift up the atmosphere of solemn grandeur of the ceremony for the commemoration of our 20th Anniversary, consecration of our Company Colours and promotion of our current boys.

#### Achievements

In the Boys’ Brigade, character development is crucial too. While BB events such as the BB National Share-A-Gift, BB Cares Project and National Purple Parade have turned virtual, its programmes have retained its meaning for our boys, who have learned to express compassion for the less fortunate as well as to show appreciation for the people around them. The boys are also given the opportunities to strive for excellence by representing the school in various national competitions such as the BB Character Quest in which teamwork is also emphasised. The CVSS Boys’ Brigade teams have consistently achieved Honour Roll awards in the national competitions such as the Gold Honours Award for Character Quest this year.&nbsp; The boys have also been consistently awarded the Best Boy Award and BB Founder’s Boy Award from BBHQ every year, which are the highest accolades for BB Boys in Singapore. For 2020, our CSM Aaron Foong clinched the BB Best Boy and BB Founder’s Boy Awards. Another BB Boy, Yeo Jing Kai, was also awarded the BB Founder’s Boy Award. The results for the 2021 awardees are not released at the present time.

CVSS Boys’ Brigade (BB) is a CCA that focuses on the development of the youth. Its mission is to nurture youth, based on sound values, to lead and serve.  

With a team of committed teachers, officers and boy leaders, the BB has established a strong track record in the annual JM Fraser Award for Unit Excellence awarded by BB Headquarters (BBHQ). For the assessment period of 2019/2020, our BB unit achieved the Gold Award which is the highest accolade for BB Companies in Singapore.

#### Programmes

The BB’s innovative, customised and integrated 4-year programmes consist of activities and events either organised internally or by BBHQ. Our programmes aim to build confidence, leadership skills and civic-mindeness in our boys. Due to the COVID-19 this year, we came up with new programmes to engage our boys meaningfully. Some of these programmes were e-CCA sessions over Zoom and in-house enrichment activities such as musketry, archery and first aid training within the school compound. For the first time in Singapore BB history, our BB unit held an e-Enrolment Service in May with a turn up of almost 100 people over Zoom to welcome our new secondary one boys in the presence of their parents, ex-cadets and officers from BBHQ. We also had a virtual exchange in December between our unit and our twinning Boy Brigade unit in Chonburi, Thailand, with whom we have had a long-standing partnership. Our boys learnt much from the inter-unit sharing and hands-on team building games held virtually in real time in our respective school compounds.  
  

#### Achievements  

In BB, character development is crucial too. BB events such as the ‘BB&nbsp; National Share-A-Gift’ and ‘BB Cares Project’ turned virtual this year. This helps our boys to demostrate compassion for the less fortunate as well as show appreciation for the people around them. The boys are also given the opportunities to strive for excellence by representing the school in various national competitions such as the ‘BB Blaze’ and ‘BB Character Quest’ in which teamwork is also emphasised. The CVSS BB teams have consistently achieved Honour Roll awards in these national competitions although this year they have been put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp; Boys from our unit have also been consistently awarded the Best Boy Award and BB Founder’s Boy Award from BBHQ every year, which are the highest accolades for BB Boys in Singapore. For 2019, our CSM Jaden Tan clinched the BB Best Boy and BB Founder’s Boy Awards. The list of 2020 awardees will be announced at a later date.
