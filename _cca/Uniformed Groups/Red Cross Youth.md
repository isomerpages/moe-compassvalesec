### Direction for 2021

CVSS Red Cross Youth (RCY) aims to integrates character-building, leadership, essential life-saving skills and blood donation knowledge. As a uniform group, we hope to instill values of self-discipline, order and teamwork in our cadets. Contrary to popular belief that Red Cross Youth only teaches First Aid, we also expose our cadets to activities and lessons such as Disaster Management, Foot-Drill, Outdoor Activity and Red Cross Knowledge. Our cadets are also exposed to various activities at Red Cross Headquarters and competitions such as Annual Red Cross Flag Day & National First Aid Competition.   

### Signature Projects 

2021 was a challenging year for the unit due to COVID-19 restrictions and other SMMs that were in place. However we managed to carry out our weekly training sessions and activities through e-CCA and some face-to face interactions when permitted. The e-CCA sessions have made our cadets to be more adaptable, resilient and confident team players.  Reflections during training sessions help cadets continually unit leaders spearhead the planning and execution of key programmes such as the annual camp.  

### Aspirations

CVSS Red Cross Youth has also formed partnerships with many external organisations and partners. Notable among them are the Sengkang Community Club, Red Cross Home for Disabled, Jamiyah Home for the Aged and Rivervale Primary School Red Cross unit. We work closely with our partners for our yearly Blood Donation Drives and conduct home visits and Cadet-Link Activities. These activities provide our cadets with opportunities to serve and interact with others. We hope that in 2022 we would be able to pursue these partnerships and ensure that our cadets have a meaningful and fruitful time in CVSS Red Cross Youth.

CVSS Red Cross Youth (RCY) is a co-curricular activity (CCA) that integrates character-building, leadership, essential life-saving skills and blood donation knowledge. As a uniformed group, we instill the values of self-discipline, order and teamwork in our cadets. Contrary to popular belief that Red Cross Youth only teaches First Aid, we also expose our cadets to a wide range of relevant and related activities and lessons such as Disaster Management, Foot Drill, Outdoor Activity and Red Cross Knowledge. Our cadets are also exposed to various activities at Red Cross Headquarters and competitions such as Annual Red Cross Flag Day and National First Aid Competition. Red Cross Youth prepares our cadets for leadership in their families and communities. This is in line with the Ministry of Education’s approach of developing 21st century competencies in our youths, with a focus on character development and citizenship education.

Through our weekly training sessions and activities, our cadets are groomed to become good citizens with a strong sense of civic responsibility. They are trained to be adaptable, resilient and confident team players. Each Red Cross Youth cadet is given opportunities to lead and serve through the running of training sessions and events.  

### What we accomplished in 2020

This year, CVSS Red Cross Youth achieved the Excellent Unit Award (Gold) for the 15th consecutive year, a testament to our longstanding commitment to excellence in training and event management, and participation in community service activities. Besides that, we were also able to win the Bloodmobile Organizer Merit Award (BMO). Added to that was the bagging of the Gold award in the First Aid Competition Junior category conducted by the Red Cross HQ.

### Partnering the community

CVSS Red Cross Youth also has formed partnerships with many external organisations and partners. Notable among them are the Sengkang Community Club, Red Cross Home for Disabled, Jamiyah Home for the Aged and Rivervale Primary School Red Cross unit. We work closely with our partners for our yearly Blood Donation Drives and conduct home visits and Cadet-Link Activities. These activities provide our cadets with opportunities to serve and interact with others.
