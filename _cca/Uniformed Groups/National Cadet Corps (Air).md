CVSS National Cadet Corps (NCC) Air aims to develop resourceful, responsible, and resilient leaders who have a resilient mind, fit body and committed heart through fun, yet challenging military-related activities. Besides introducing cadets to useful skills for National Service (for the boys), our NCC Air Curriculum is intended to sharpen cadets’ competencies and knowledge in preparation for post-secondary education and career prospects in the aviation industry.

Assistant Platoon Sergeant of Junior Cadets 2019 Zachary Phuah Jiawei earned his promotion to Cadet Officer. Although Inter-Unit Competitions were suspended for the year 2021, our unit joined the “Keep Your Red Alive!” National Day Competition by Sengkang Central Youth Network to contribute to the National Day celebrations of SengKang Community Club and earned a participation award. Our alumni Master Sergeant(NCC) Keith and Master Sergeant(NCC) Kenji got the outstanding cadet award. Many of our Cadet Leaders have participated in a “KBA Gold Workshop'' in the year 2020 and we have received an award for completing it successfully in the year 2021.

#### Programmes  

This year was NCC’s 120th year and there were several activities and competitions held for the various NCC units to compete virtually due to the SMM restrictions. One event in particular which bonded the cadets was the NCC 120 Race, which aimed to help them stay fit and healthy.  All members of CVSS NCC (Air) unit participated in the NCC 120 Race, including our teacher officers, Mr Andrea Ang and Mdm Mildred Chew.  Some of our senior cadets did the unit proud by earning a spot on the NCC Leaderboard. 

Other than the NCC120 Virtual Race, our junior cadets attended a KBA Bronze Workshop organised by the Singapore Kindness Movement via a Zoom session.  Five of our junior cadets participated in the  “Guardians of the City(GOTC)” Competition where they had to design and create a custom GOTC card. Through this activity, our unit was able to reach out to the community in terms of maintaining a positive neighbourhood environment.

Aspirations

We aspire to bring our whole unit to greater heights despite challenges brought about  by the pandemic. The strong sense of pride and dedication displayed by our cadets and teacher officers have laid the  foundation for a resolute and admirable unit. The unit  aspires to continue to strengthen the bonds between fellow cadets and uphold the prestige of our unit.

### Achievements

Despite the constraints brought about by COVID-19, 2019-2020 was still an eventful period for CVSS NCC. Five of our Cadet Leaders graduated from the Senior Specialist Leadership Course as part of their leadership training assessment. Two of our Senior Cadet Leaders also earned promotions to Cadet Officers. Although Inter-Unit Competitions were suspended for the year 2020, our unit was represented by Muhammad Hussien Bin Akhbar Ali from 3T1 at NDP 2020. 

### Programmes

Our cadets also contributed in various school and community-based events through the year, whether through setting up education booths for ‘Total Defence Day’, or participating in the production of school’s National Day online celebrations. This year, our Junior and Senior Cadets attended the ‘KBA Bronze Workshop’, which was organised by Singapore Kindness Movement. This workshop prepared them to leverage social media to promote the value of kindness among Singaporeans. The cadets will be embarking on their Gold projects this holidays by running a social media campaign to raise awareness on issues of their choice.

### Aspirations

Our aspirations in bringing our unit to greater heights motivate us to produce better performances. The pride and dedication of our cadets and teacher officers have indeed established a strong foundation to build for ourselves a purposeful and well-respected unit.
