# 2021
The Netball CCA’s goal for 2021 was to develop students’ passion for the game of netball and sports, to nurture them to become independent and responsible leaders who are also critical thinkers, and to excel in netball competitions that they participate in.  

While netball competitions and carnivals were still suspended this year, the netball team continued their quest for learning of the game and maintaining their physical fitness through a combination of e-CCA through video conferencing and face-to-face CCA sessions. 

The team treasured the face-to-face CCA sessions and also enjoyed and benefitted from the range of activities planned during e-CCA sessions. The team was able to spend more time on activities such as strength and conditioning for injury prevention, deep stretching for flexibility, and even show-and-tell of their preparation of a healthy meal during e-CCA sessions guided by the coach. 

For the year 2022, the netball team hopes to have the opportunity to take part in external competitions and to do their best. The team is also committed to treasuring the opportunities during CCA sessions to lead by example, share with and learn from each other.

The Netball CCA’s goal for 2020 was to develop students’ passion for the game of netball and sports, to nurture them to become independent and responsible leaders who are also critical thinkers, and to excel in netball competitions that we participate in. 

During the North Zone Netball Championships, the ‘B’ Division team were deserved winners of three games, while they fought hard in the other three, losing narrowly to two of their opponents. The team members continued to keep up with their fitness by doing fitness workouts suitable for home even when the circuit breaker period ensued. 

At the beginning stage of the gradual resumption of CCA, e-CCA sessions were conducted by the coach and hosted by the teachers in-charge through video conferencing. 

Besides fitness training guided by the coach during e-CCA sessions, the students were enthusiastic about and appreciative of the creative activities planned by team members, such as team bonding games that allowed all to know one annother better, values sharing by coach using famous athletes as examples, and reflection and feedback sessions on team and training matters. Netball CCA has resumed long-awaited physical CCA sessions since then with safe-distance management measures in place.

For the year 2021, the netball team hopes to be able to better previous years’ results in competitions. The team is also committed to treasuring the opportunities during the CCA sessions to lead by example, share with and learn from another.
