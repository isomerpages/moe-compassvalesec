Despite the restrictions of the Safe Management Measures, the Compassvale Badminton players remained passionate and committed to the sport. While adhering to the new safety measures, the players seized every opportunity to practice on courts, showing their dedication. The team was also able to improve their technical skills and train their mental toughness in competitions with the guidance of our experienced badminton coach.

  

Once again, the Compassvale Badminton team did the school proud by finishing in the top 8 in North Zone for the highly competitive ‘B’ Division.  The players fought with great tenacity, displaying strong resilience while playing against top teams in the North Zone. The players also showed great team spirit on the courts, encouraging each other to do their best.
