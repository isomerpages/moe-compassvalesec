Despite the restrictions of the Safe Management Measures, the Compassvale Badminton players remained passionate and committed to the sport. While adhering to the new safety measures, the players seized every opportunity to practice on courts, showing their dedication. The team was also able to improve their technical skills and train their mental toughness in competitions with the guidance of our experienced badminton coach.

  

Once again, the Compassvale Badminton team did the school proud by finishing in the top 8 in North Zone for the highly competitive ‘B’ Division.  The players fought with great tenacity, displaying strong resilience while playing against top teams in the North Zone. The players also showed great team spirit on the courts, encouraging each other to do their best.

The Compassvale Badminton CCA works hard to maintain a challenging and safe environment that is fun for the students. Besides the technical aspects of the sport, the CCA also aims to provide opportunities to help develop and enhance students’ leadership skills as well as imbuing in them positive values such as resilience and respect.  

In the North Zone Inter-School Badminton Competition, Compassvale Badminton Team has been consistently finishing in the top 8 of the highly competitive North Zone. Since the resumption of physical CCA sessions after circuit breaker, the CCA has been following the Safe Management Measure regulations closely and students have welcomed the regular and rigorous training sessions.

The school team has employed an experienced coach who shares a wealth of valuable technical and tactical experience with the players. The training focusses on developing both the physical and mental aspects of the players and we also hope to hone the players’ techniques so as to be competitive in our cluster.
