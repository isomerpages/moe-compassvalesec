The CVSS Basketball Team maintains a high standard of professionalism and sportsmanship. While the commitment to train hard and play tough is the baseline, the players are also expected to demonstrate good behaviour and excel in their studies.  

  

The team trains regularly throughout the year in preparation for both the North Zone ‘B’ and ‘C’ Divisions Basketball Championships. Under the guidance of our coach, Mr Vincent Ong, our players train twice a week at the school basketball court.

Each training session is tailored to hone the physical, technical as well as the tactical skills of each member, bearing in mind the position he or she plays in.

  

During the June and November school holidays, all the basketballers dedicate themselves to preparing for their respective upcoming championships, putting in extra work in training, especially in the aspect of physical conditioning. With competitions in 2020 curtailed due to the pandemic, we continue to train and eagerly await the opportunity to compete again in 2021.

  

To move forward and realise the team’s goal, all the basketballers have been inculcated to live by the motto: ‘One Team, One Dream’.
