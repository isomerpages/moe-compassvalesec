The Softball CCA aims to build resilience in students by challenging them to give their best efforts in training and in competitive matches. We want to build confidence in students by giving each individual the opportunity to lead during the game and to harness leadership skills through organising and planning student-initiated activities. 

This year, due to the COVID-19 situation, the CCA has been adaptable and made adjustments to the CCA sessions by toggling between physical sessions and e-CCA sessions according to the SMM requirements.

In addition, the Softball CCA has conducted Direct School Admission for boys’ teams this year in order to further enhance the performance of the teams in competition.

**The core values of the Softball CCA are:**

**Passion**:  We enjoy what we do, and we do it well.

**Preparation**:     There are no shortcuts to success. We put in the effort required.

**Teamwork**: We are committed to one another. We choose to do what is the best for the team.

**Respect**: We treat others the way we want to be treated

**Resilience**: We embrace challenges and view failure as an opportunity. We believe in our ability to improve.

**Staying Positive:**  We always demonstrate positive winning posture.

In all, we want the students to have an enriching experience playing and learning the sport, and at the same time, build their resilience. The students will be able to demonstrate respect in victory, graciousness in defeat, appreciate the camaraderie and bonding built with one another and learn to always keep a healthy lifestyle.
