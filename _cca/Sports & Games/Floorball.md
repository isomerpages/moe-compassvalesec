The CVSS floorball team was formed in 2017 and works towards a common goal of making floorball an established CCA. Training sessions and competitions, together with the commitment shown by our floorballers, have forged the team to become one that is closely knit and united. Both the boys and the girls teams annually represent the school in the National School Games to pit themselves against teams from other schools.   

The team has progressed tremendously since its founding. Training sessions focus on building fitness and improving the technical skills and tactical knowledge of our floorballers. Due to the pandemic, e-CCA sessions have become more common this year. Apart from fitness training provided by our innovative coaches, values and sportsmanship are also discussed comprehensively to improve our floorballers holistically. 

For the coming year the floorball team aims to improve on our previous competition results. With the resumption of physical CCA sessions and with safe-distance management measures, our floorballers can look forward to another exciting year of development and participation in competitions.

Floorball is a safe and versatile indoor team sport played in a rink. Each team has five field players and a goalkeeper on the field at the same time. Floorball is played with plastic sticks and a very light ball and with a goalkeeper without a stick. The main objective in floorball is to score more goals than the opponent. Even though it is relatively safer, it is no less physically demanding and develops the players’ 21st century competencies – challenging the players to build values like teamwork and to think fast.   

The CVSS floorball team was formed in 2017 and working towards a common goal of making the floorball an established CCA has allowed the floorballers to become a closely knit team comprising the boys’ and girls’ teams. Members of the team will represent the school and participate in the annual National School Games in the ‘B’ and ‘C’ Divisions and pit themselves against teams from other schools. 

The team has progressed a lot since its founding. Our pioneer batch of boys were unbeaten in their first round matches in this year’s National School Games and were through to the second round. Unfortunately, the competition was cut short by the pandemic. We are still growing and we hope to be able to achieve greater heights in time to come.
