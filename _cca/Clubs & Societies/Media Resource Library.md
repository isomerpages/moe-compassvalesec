The School Library Club seeks to ignite the love for reading in everyone through our array of special events such as ‘Library week’ and ‘Discovering Singapore Authors’. 

Through training sessions and quarterly meetings, our library members interact and share ideas on archiving and book reviews. 

### Partnership with ItsRainingRaincoats (IRR)

Our collaboration with IRR enables our students to give back to the community. In 2021, as part of our community outreach initiative, student librarians created a video that introduces the sights and sounds of Singapore to our migrant workers. 

### The S.U.R.E. Prove It! Contest 2021 with NLB

The S.U.R.E. Prove It! Contest 2021 is organised by the National Library Board and aims to equip students with information literacy skills in the digital age and apply it to current affairs online. Through this platform the selected student librarians created a short video about ways to apply the S.U.R.E. steps and advocate the key messages on fake news to the student population to become effective advocates of information literacy.  

### Library Week!

Library Week! intends to ignite interest in reading and draw more users to the Library Language and Literary Appreciation. The students curated engaging activities such as the Escape room and scavenger hunt. These interactive adventure games provide students with a chance to be a part of a story and apply critical thinking and collaboration skills. Although the event was cancelled due to the pandemic, we hope that the ideas and activities our students have prepared can be brought forward in 2022.

 The Media Resource Library seeks to ignite the love for reading in everyone through our array of special events and themes such as ‘CSI’, ‘Discovering Singapore Authors’ and ‘Celebrating Friendships’. 

Through training sessions and quarterly meetings, our library members interact and share ideas on archiving and book reviews. 

### Partnership with Sengkang Public Library

Our close partnership with Sengkang Public Library enables our students to give back to the community. Selected students learn from experienced librarians about the duties and responsibilities of being an ambassador of reading for life. Students get to immerse themselves in the real-life setting of interacting with members of the public and gain knowledge on the complexities of archiving, shelving and curating books in the library. In 2019, as part of our community outreach initiative, student librarians organised and conducted ‘Racial Synergy’ at Sengkang Public Library, which was an event to celebrate our multi-racial diversity.

### Stories We Tell

‘Stories We Tell’ is an annual Literary Arts event which intends to ignite and celebrate our North Stars’ passion for the literary arts by showcasing their talents in areas such as poetry recital and drama. Due to the pandemic, this year’s event was held virtually with students submitting their poetry recitals online instead. Chosen entries were then shared with the rest of the school community during the Language and Literary Appreciation segment of the post-examination programme.
