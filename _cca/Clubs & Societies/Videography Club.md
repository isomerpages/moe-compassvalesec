The Videography Club was established in 2007 with the aim of nurturing well-rounded infocomm enthusiasts who are passionate about video production and active in providing videography support for school events, presentations and competitions.

  

### What we achieved in 2020

Our students participated in N.E.mation!, an annual nationwide digital animation competition for youths to express their ideas on the topic of Total Defence. Our members had to create and develop stories about the five pillars of Total Defence. Four of our groups were in the Top 100 teams selected for their stories, advancing to the next round of the competition. Our members had the opportunity to attend various online workshops to further develop their stories. Through their efforts and guidance from the Videography teachers, one of our teams was selected as the Top 10 finalists. 

  

### Sessions in 2020

Our members went through a student-led workshop for an editing app called “Vlogit”. The introduction of apps to our CCA would mean that our members could explore and develop their work more freely as the app is made accessible to them. Members also went through online workshops, expert coaching and peer sharing, acquiring skills ranging from the handling of specialised equipment, storyboarding and camera techniques, to editing footages and managing post-production enhancement. In the process, the club proactively instils in members positive attitudes in life such as teamwork, self-responsibility and resilience.

  

The fruits of their development include the contributions they have made to the production of quality videos for the school such as various informative videos for Chinese New Year and National Education Commemorative assembly programmes like Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day and Racial Harmony Day.
