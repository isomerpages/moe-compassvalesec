The Community Youth Leaders (CYL) Club was set up in 2019 as an extension of the school’s Learning for Life Programme in Community & Youth Leadership. Its mission is to propel its members to inspire and encourage their fellow North Stars to serve others by instilling civic-mindedness and igniting their passion for serving.  

### What We Do

Members undergo a variety of workshops that seek to develop their planning and organisational skills, socio-emotional competencies and reflective practices. With these skills and competencies, they plan and carry out projects that meet the needs of our beneficiaries. Through these platforms, members cultivate empathy and compassion for people around them. Additionally, these learning experiences nurture our youth leaders to discover their voice and advocate for social causes within and beyond our school.  

Last year, the CYL Club was able to identify and serve diverse groups in our community where we could make a positive impact, namely the elderly, patients from Sengkang Community Hospital, and low-income families. This year, despite the limitations caused by the pandemic, our students observed the safe management measures and continued to engage community partners. Due to the social isolation that comes with the Safe Management Measures, it is increasingly important that our students spread love and kindness around the community.  

### Accomplishments in 2021

1. Chinese New Year Celebration via Zoom with Sengkang Community Hospital and Bethesda  C.A.R.E Senior Activity Centre

Members delivered some festive cheer to the patients and elderly by engaging them in conversation and activities such as folding origami, a sing-along session and dance. They also prepared a video to send their new year greetings to the beneficiaries to warm their hearts.
