The PA/AVA/Videography Club plays a critical role in managing the school’s audio-visual infrastructure and in providing videography services to support school events. Besides honing their competence and building their confidence in the operation of PA equipment through weekly training sessions, members also learn on the job while performing routine duties such as daily morning assembly duty. These experiences ensure that members are operationally ready for every school event. All new members are also provided grounding in videography training ranging from handling of specialised equipment, storyboarding and camera techniques, to editing footages and managing post-production enhancement. Guided by the teachers, senior members are provided opportunities to conduct training sessions for peers and juniors.

Through these various platforms, the PA/AVA/Videography Club aims to not only equip members with technical expertise and enable them to develop their interest in these fields, but also inculcate in them core values such as responsibility, and build social-emotional competencies such as relationship management and 21st century competencies for a globalised world such as communication, collaboration and information skills.

### Accomplishments in 2021

Despite the curtailed CCA programme this year due to safe management measures, we nonetheless strived our utmost to provide a meaningful CCA experience for our members. Building on the success of chairperson (videography) Zoe, who achieved a Top 10 placing in the previous edition, members collaborated in groups and exercised creativity to take part in the annual N.E.mation! 2022 competition where they have to create storyboards to illustrate the Total Defence Day 2021 theme of ‘Together we keep Singapore strong’. Additionally, selected members participated in video production competitions and assisted in producing videos to support school events such as Library Week. Members also maximised the reduced physical CCA sessions to ensure they continue to be conversant with the operation of audio-visual equipment and that these skills are passed down effectively.

The PA/AVA/Robotics Club plays a critical role in manning the school’s audio and visual infrastructure to support school events. Besides acquiring new skills and developing competencies in the operation of the PA equipment through weekly training programme, students also learn on the job while performing routine duties (e.g., morning assembly daily duties). These experiences ensure that students are operationally ready for every school event. The PA/ AVA /Robotics Club strongly believes in inculcating leadership, teamwork, responsibility and resilience in every crew member. From robotics training and competition, to PA/AVA training on the use of various PA equipment, every member is given opportunities to lead and demonstrate his/her leadership qualities and creativity.

### What we accomplished in 2020

This year, due to the COVID-19 situation, our members were only able to take part in the 16th Robotic Challenge organised by ITE College East in February, where they gained invaluable experience in problem solving and robotics programming. To ensure our members remain in-touch with their skills in handling audio-visual equipment, they attended specially created online tutorials before physical CCA sessions were allowed to resume.

Moving forward, to better cater to the interests of our students, PA/AVA/Robotics will undergo a reshuffle – welcoming Videography into our fold and allowing Robotics to be a separate CCA. The teachers in charge of PA/AVA/Videography will continue to identify various platforms for our students to enhance their technical skills in handling audio and visual equipment as well as nurturing their talents and skills in video production. This allows Robotics to better focus their efforts towards developing in students necessary STEM knowledge and creativity in robotics through customised training and preparation for challenging competitions.
