The Environment Club was set up in 2006 and has since grown from a handful of enthusiastic students into a thriving group of students who are passionate about championing the environmental cause. The activities conducted by the Environment Club seek to foster the attitude of ‘I know, I act and I promote’ in our Environment Champions. In other words, to be ardent and committed leaders in advocating the practice of the 3Rs - reduce, reuse and recycle for sustainable living.

Every year, the Environment Club partners the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum to organise exciting learning journeys to nature reserves such as Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve or participate in educational workshops such as the HSBC Marine Protection Programme in order to heighten environmental awareness amongst our Environment Champions.

The Environment Club also collaborates with the International Seakeepers Society to provide our Environment Champions with a unique experience to go onboard a berthed yacht at Keppel Marina to learn about climate change and its impact on coral reefs.

Our Environment Champions are also given opportunities to participate in symposiums and webinars such as the Green Symposium @ MPS and Living in Harmony with Nature and the Planet 2021 which enabled them to interact and exchange ideas with like-minded students from other schools as well as connect with inspiring individuals and organisations who champion the environment cause.   

This year, our Environment Champions displayed much grit and tenacity through competitions such as the 2021 Crea8 Sustainability Competition organised by PacificLight where they achieved stellar results for their outstanding entries based on the theme ‘Re-create, Recycle, Re-purpose’. They also participated in competitions such as the G!nnovation Challenge 2020 and the Singapore Energy Grand Challenge 2020 to brainstorm for creative solutions to existing environmental challenges such as waste and energy management.

Furthermore, our key community outreach programmes such as the International Coastal Clean-Up and the North East Clean & Green Carnival provide our Environment Champions with a platform to actively organise and participate in environmental activities which promote environmental awareness amongst members of the wider community. Through these valuable learning experiences, our Environment Champions have developed into worthy advocates of environmental sustainability.

Our close partnerships with national environmental agencies such as the National Environment Agency (NEA), Public Utilities Board (PUB) and National Parks Board (NParks) have enabled us to further enhance our existing 3Rs, water and biodiversity programmes. Each year, our Environment Champions commemorate key environmental events such as World Water Day and Earth Day to inculcate sustainable green habits within our school community.  

Our Environment Champions have also participated in upcycling workshops and attended exhibitions at the Clean and Green Eco School Day organised by NEA to enhance their environmental knowledge. Moreover, the Environment Club partnered PUB in adopting Sengkang Floating Wetland and developing the Friends of Water programme. Finally, we collaborated with NParks to embark on the Greening Schools for Biodiversity Programme under the Community in Nature Initiative to enable our Environment Champions to better appreciate and conserve our natural biodiversity.

In recognition of our school’s efforts in promoting environmental awareness within and beyond our school community, we were awarded the Vanda Miss Joaquim Sustained Achievement Award, the pinnacle award under the SEC-Starhub School Green Awards 2021 as well as the prestigious North East District Environment Award by NEA. Our school was also designated as a ‘Bright Spot’ within school by the Public Hygiene Council (PHC) and MOE CCE under the ‘Keep Singapore Clean Movement’ since 2016.
