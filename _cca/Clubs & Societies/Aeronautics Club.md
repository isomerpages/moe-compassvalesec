The CVSS Aeronautics Club seeks to nurture our North Stars’ passion for flying machines by equipping them with the necessary knowledge and skills, further supporting the school’s aeronautics-focused Applied Learning Programme (ALP).  

### Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition (SAFMC) 2021

Once again, our members performed exceedingly well at the SAFMC 2021, surpassing our past achievements to attain even more glowing results:

Unpowered Gliders Category  
* Championship Award, 3rd Placing  
* Best Performance Award, 1st Placing  
* Best Presentation Award, 1st Placing  
  
Fixed-Wing Radio-Controlled Flight  
* Championship Award, 1st Placing  
* Best Performance Award, 1st and 3rd Placing  
* Prove of Flight & Learning Journey Video, 3rd Placing  
  
Semi-Autonomous Drone Challenge  
* Championship Award, 2nd Placing  
  
First-Person-View Drone Racing  
* Novice Category, 6th Position  
* Advanced Category, 6th Position

Making use of every opportunity available, including e-CCA sessions and school holidays, our members displayed grit and teamwork to hone their skills and acquire aeronautics knowledge for the competition. It was heart-warming to see the North Star spirit in action: the seniors guiding the juniors with enthusiasm, the veterans coaching the novice with patience, and the teachers spurring everyone to press on. Results aside, it was certainly an unforgettable and fruitful learning journey for all who came on board.

### Weekly CCA Sessions and Workshops

Despite COVID-19, our members were not deprived of opportunities to learn. The Secondary One members, under the coaching of the seniors, constructed their first unpowered gliders at home, while the seniors further developed their drone coding skills through online platforms. They also had the chance to learn about the “Future of Flying Cars and Aerospace Technology”, as well as interact with industry experts and even a NASA Astronaut via video conferencing during the Aspire Week organised by the Aspire Labs and Singapore Science Centre. In addition, hybrid hands-on/virtual sessions on Drone Swarming and MircoSoft Flight Simulator were organised whenever possible. These diverse activities ensured that our members are kept abreast of developments in the field of aero-modeling and aviation, and helped to further sustain their passion and deepen their knowledge.

### Opportunities Beyond the Classroom

Apart from pursuing excellence in competitions, the Aeronautics Club also aims to inculcate initiatives and self-confidence as well as values of resilience, respect and graciousness amongst our members. CCA leaders were tasked to lead e-CCA discussions and conduct e-training sessions. Volunteer members had the chance to interact with pilots from Singapore Airlines as well as senior officers from SYFC. A few seniors were also selected to meet virtually with the directors of CAAS and polytechnic lecturers, during which they discussed the impact of COVID-19 and the prospect of the aviation industry in the next few years. In school, the senior members organised recreational activities that fostered camaraderie among members.

### Drone Odyssey Challenge 2020

Our members performed outstandingly well at the Drone Odyssey Challenge 2020, organised by the Singapore Science Centre. In the Obstacle Challenge category, out of twelve individual submissions from our school, a bumper crop of eight submissions came in amongst the top ten, each receiving the Best Flying Award and a prize money of $200. Displaying grit, creativity and camaraderie, our North Stars made use of every opportunity, such as the e-CCA sessions as well as the school holidays to sharpen their skills in drone coding and obstacle design. As the drones were not designed to fly with precision, it took them numerous attempts to finally capture a successful flight. 

Our North Stars also excelled in the Drone Coding Challenge. Out of 30 nation-wide recipients of the Distinction Award, as many as 21 belonged to our school!

### VC Conversations, e-Training Sessions and Workshops

Despite COVID-19, our members were not deprived of opportunities to learn. The Secondary One members, under the coaching of the seniors, constructed their first unpowered gliders at home, while the seniors further developed their drone coding skills through online platforms. Video Conference (VC) sessions with the Singapore Youth Flying Club (SYFC) and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) were organised for those who are keen to interact with the aviation gurus to obtain firsthand information about the industry. In addition, hands-on workshops on Flight Simulator, Radio-Controlled Planes as well as First-Person Drone Flying were organised before and after the circuit-breaker period. These diverse activities ensured that our members are kept abreast of developments in the field of aero-modeling and aviation, and helped to further sustain their passion and deepen their knowledge.
