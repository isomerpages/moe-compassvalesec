Compassvale Concert Band was formed in 2000. Under the baton of experienced band conductor, Mr Toh Yang Yang, our members are exposed to a wide variety of music and have participated in various school performances such as Chinese New Year Celebration, Anniversary and Awards Day and National Day Concert. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, band members not only performed but were also socially engaged with the community such as at Sengkang General Hospital during the SchoolARTS@ SKH programme. Such activities aided band members in building their character. Recreational activities, band exchanges and the annual band camp fostered teamwork and strengthened friendships. In addition, band members are given opportunities for appreciation of music through concert viewings.   

However, due to the pandemic, we have to put such events on hold. Some band practices were conducted online and strict Safe Management Measures were in place during face-to-face sessions. With only about 3.5 months of face-to-face practices, our students displayed their resilience, perseverance, proficiency and professionalism to achieve the Certificate of Accomplishment in the recent Singapore Youth Festival 2021 Arts Presentation.

The band continues to be a part of the students’ holistic school experience. Through eCCA sessions conducted through online video conferencing, band members are engaged in an alternative band experience with opportunities for music appreciation and composition.   
  

Driven by passion and a strong sense of commitment, the band believes in continuous learning and always soaring towards excellence. The band aims to develop band members into resilient and confident individuals through provision of an enriching and holistic experience that develops their musical talent, life skills and character.

Besides playing music, other activities conducted for band members also aid in building their character such as performance at Sengkang General Hospital during the SchoolARTS@ SKH programme where the band members were socially engaged with the community. Through recreational activities, band exchanges and the annual band camp, teamwork is fostered and friendships are strengthened.
