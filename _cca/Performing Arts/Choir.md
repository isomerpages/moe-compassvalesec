This was an interesting year for Team Choir as members rode the wave in these challenging times to realise their fullest potential in making music together. Team Choir continued adopting the online format (eCCA) in adherence to COVID-19 measures. Although there was no judging to rank the participants as in previous years, this year’s Singapore Youth Festival 2021 Arts Presentation saw Choir members display their commitment, resilience and perseverance in giving their best during the final recordings. Despite not being able to sing together in a big group, the adjudicators affirmed their hard work through positive feedback. Their comments included the Team Choir’s ability to maintain a strong rhythmic sense and energy in delivering the songs.

Through eCCA sessions under the guidance of the Choir Instructor, Ms Angela Lee, members learnt alternative chorale experience with opportunities to appreciate and create music. As part of their holistic school experience, members also had the opportunity to participate in the PAYM Love Red @ St. Andrew Nursing Home – Postcard Design and Video Performance Contest;  Team Choir’s submission clinched the 4th position in the group category. Collaboration with other schools continued online through activities such as virtual Choir sessions and chorale exchanges. In order to not let the pandemic dampened the mood, Team Choir boosted morale with activities such team-bonding games, intra-team song competition and the annual Year-End Farewell get together albeit in an online setting.

Moving forward, our members believe in our motto of singing together with ‘One Heart, One Voice’. We hope to share our love for choral music and to touch the hearts of people around us through our performance and appreciation of our diverse repertoire of music.

 The year started on a high for members as our school choir was selected to be part of the Combined Schools Choir Contingent for this year’s 55th National Day Celebrations. However, when the pandemic gained momentum, the chorale landscape drastically changed. Our plans for 2020 were deeply affected. The Choir swiftly adopted the online format when school reopened in June.

Under the guidance of the Choir Instructor, Ms Angela Lee, students were taught music theory so that they would be able to confidently sight-sing simple music pieces. Students were also exposed to music recording apps which they were able to use to record their individual singing for the school’s Teachers’ Day Celebrations and picked up video techniques while recording virtual choir performances. 

Although plans for the Combined Choir Contingent for the National Day Celebrations were cancelled, our school’s choir continued to look for opportunities to engage students and amongst the activities we took part in this year was the commemorative virtual choir organised by the SYFgoesOnline! Team. The SYF x NDP Stronger Together video: Be The Light video was included as a class resource for the commemoration of National Day in schools on 7 August and was featured in a live TV broadcast as part of NDP 2020.

One of our members, Julia Yago from 3E3 also represented the school at the National Teachers’ Day Virtual Choir Video. She took the opportunity to participate as a way of thanking our school teachers. Julia was among the 300 students featured in the video. Members also took part in the PAYM Love Red @ St. Andrew Nursing Home - Postcard Design and Video Performance Contest Results and one of our groups, comprising Cheryl Lian Wan Lyn (3E4) and Chloe Tan Xin Kai (3E3), clinched the Top 3 position in the Individual/Duet category.

Our members are driven by our motto of singing together with ‘One Heart, One Voice’. We hope to share our love for choral music and touch the hearts of people around us through our performance and appreciation of our diverse repertoire of music. Simultaneously, our members will continue to grow in confidence through our performances -  both virtual and on stage. With hard work and continued effort, our choir will remain a close-knit community which will strive for excellence and realise the star within all of our choristers.
