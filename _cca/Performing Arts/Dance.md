Great dancers are not great because of their technique; they are great because they dance from the heart and let their passion shine through. That holds true for Compassvale Secondary School Dance CCA – our dancers exude passion and commitment. Under the guidance of dance instructor Ms Quek Shir Lyn, the Compassvale Secondary School Dance CCA incorporates modern dance techniques and contemporary arts into their dance pieces.

Although this year has continued to be a special year, with a mixture of physical and eCCA sessions, our dancers continued to show resilience and commitment. Despite strict SMM measures being in place during physical sessions, and limited space for physical movements during eCCA sessions, they turned up for each session diligently and followed through with each session.

This year, our dancers participated in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation for International Dance with the dance titled ‘Lost it To Trying’. Despite having to modify training to adhere to SMM measures, our dancers persevered in practising for the presentation, showing great discipline and commitment. Their efforts paid off as they were awarded the Certificate of Distinction.

 Our dancers also had the opportunity to participate in a NAC-AEP dance workshop where they could come together in small groups to learn choreography and conduct mini showcases to their peers.  

These platforms have instilled the school values of resilience, graciousness and respect as well as developed high levels of responsibility and commitment in the dancers. Through their experiences in dance, the CCA hopes to develop in every dancer good values and sound character, along with a lifelong passion for this performing art.  

Just as the school motto states, we hope each of our dancers will be able to realise the star within and continue to be that twinkling star that lights up the stage doing what she loves.

This year has been a special year as dancers had to embark on eCCA due to the COVID crisis. Although it has been tough as spaces for physical movements were limited, our dancers demonstrated perseverance and resilience. They turned up for each eCCA session diligently and followed through with each session.
