In Drama Club, our distinctively energetic and creative members are allowed to express themselves through the devising and performing of original scripts based on issues that they feel strongly about.

Under the guidance of a professional and experienced trainer, our members are also exposed to valuable life skills: they develop positive social and teamwork skills, learn to negotiate various viewpoints and portray a range of emotions in a safe and supportive environment. Through this, they are better able to comprehend their emotions and develop empathy with and for others.  They are constantly given opportunities to perform both within and outside school, which no doubt build their confidence as effective communicators.

Last year the Drama Club members were especially proud to have attained the Certificate of Distinction in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation for their performance of ‘Roots’. The story depicted a young girl who was determined to live her dream despite the odds against her. We also took part in SYFgoesOnline - The Young Playwright Presents 2021 Showcase where a group of our students devised a monologue inspired by the theme ‘Finding the Light’. We are proud to share that our students’ work was featured on the SYF YouTube Channel, website and various social media platforms.

The Drama Club aims not only to continue delivering engaging and thought-provoking performances for events and competitions, but also to expose its members to world-class theatrical performances of multiple genres.  

Empowering the drama members to understand and influence their world through exploring roles and situations, the Drama Club will continue to seize more opportunities to showcase their talents and passion for theatrical arts both in school and beyond. Any student who wishes to hone his/her communicative skills in a creative environment is welcome to join the Drama Club – it is where you can explore and be dramatic!
