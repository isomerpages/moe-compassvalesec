In Drama Club, our distinctively energetic and creative members are allowed to express themselves through the devising and performing of original scripts based on issues that they feel strongly about.

Under the guidance of a professional and experienced trainer, our members are also exposed to valuable life skills: they develop positive social and teamwork skills, learn to negotiate various viewpoints and portray a range of emotions in a safe and supportive environment. Through this, they are better able to comprehend their emotions and develop empathy with and for others.  They are constantly given opportunities to perform both within and outside school, which no doubt build their confidence as effective communicators.

Last year the Drama Club members were especially proud to have attained the Certificate of Distinction in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation for their performance of ‘Roots’. The story depicted a young girl who was determined to live her dream despite the odds against her. We also took part in SYFgoesOnline - The Young Playwright Presents 2021 Showcase where a group of our students devised a monologue inspired by the theme ‘Finding the Light’. We are proud to share that our students’ work was featured on the SYF YouTube Channel, website and various social media platforms.

This year, our Drama members devised and scripted an original play for “The International Science Drama Competition”, an event that aims to promote science through drama. The script was based on the theme “Healthy Plants, Healthy Planet”, commemorating 2020 as International Year of Plant Health. Some of the topics included within were “sustainable agriculture”, “food security”, and “preventing the spread of plant pests and diseases.
