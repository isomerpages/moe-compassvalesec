At Compassvale Secondary School, the Staff Well-Being Committee (SWB) is a staff-focused committee that strives towards an integrated and inclusive approach to developing and enhancing staff well-being. The committee looks into the health, social and emotional as well as work-related needs of all of our staff so as to enable them to thrive in both their personal and professional lives.

The SWB strongly believes that the well-being of staff is integral to their ability to effectively nurture the students. Promoting wellness and stress management serve to  energise the staff, enabling them to connect their life and work to their inner calling and the larger purpose of making a difference to the lives of our students and contributing to shaping the future of the nation.

With our wide-range of activities throughout the year, the SWB aims to promote staff well-being by providing various platforms and opportunities for our staff’s social, emotional and physical growth.

To meet the work-related needs of our staff, the SWB aims to be the bridge by serving as a viable communication channel for the general staff to give their feedback to the school management on work-related concerns. We also monitor key work-related processes such as the implementation of the school buddy system to improve the work of the staff. 

  

Due to the covid situation unfortunately, several of our platforms that cater to the social and emotional needs of the staff were cancelled. One such event was the staff community involvement programme (CIP), which was part of our Chinese New Year celebration, where a group of elderly from Henderson Heights would be invited to join the school’s lunar new year celebration . Even though we are not able to gather for a themed lunch event during Teachers’ Day this year due to the Covid-19 situation, we continued to show our appreciation for the teaching and non-teaching staff through a Teachers’ Day gift pack which consists of an individually written card, customised gifts and shopping vouchers. In addition, we also celebrate happy occasions with our staff for important events such as the birth of their newborns with tokens of vouchers. GrabFood vouchers were also given to all staff who attended the online Staff Mindfulness Workshop in November as staff learnt self-care tips virtually with professional trainers.

To meet the health needs of our staff, the SWB also promoted healthy lifestyle amongst the staff by coordinating healthy lifestyle programmes regularly for the staff such as our ‘Fruit of the Month’ initiative. The SWB also coordinated a complimentary health screening for our staff by professional medical teams in a stipulated medical centre with prior appointments made by the staff.

The SWB will continue to engage staff and stakeholders for feedback and ideas that can contribute towards the continuous improvement in our workplan to enhance the well-being of our staff. Even while we build the capacity and capability of our staff to face future challenges in life and the working environment by enhancing the well-being of our staff, the SWB also anchors our staff on the cultivation of "heartware" and intrinsic motivation which makes our work in education so unique. The committee  will continue to engage staff in building and sustaining their inner well-being, family values and work values. With SWB providing the opportunities, school management providing the support, and staff taking ownership of their own well-being, the SWB hopes to make Compassvale Secondary School a great place for work and growth for our staff.

At Compassvale Secondary School, the Staff Well-Being Committee (SWB) is a staff-focused committee that adopts an integrated and inclusive approach to developing and enhancing staff well-being. The committee looks into the health, social and emotional, as well as work-related needs of all of our staff so as to enable them to achieve well-being n different aspects of their lives – self, family, work, community and environment.

The SWB strongly believes that the well-being of staff is integral to the ability and success of our staff in our daily quest of nurturing our youths.  A deep sense of well-being will energise the staff and enable them to connect their life and work with their inner calling and the larger purpose of making a difference to the lives of our students and contribute to shaping the future of the nation.

With our wide-range of activities throughout the year, the SWB aims to promote staff well-being by providing various platforms and opportunities for our staff’s social, emotional and physical growth.

To meet the work-related needs of our staff, the SWB aims to be the bridge by serving as a viable communication channel for the general staff to give their feedback to the school management on work-related concerns. We also monitor key work-related processes such as the implementation of the school buddy system to improve the work of the staff.

### Platforms  

To cater to the social and emotional needs of the staff, two key SWB platforms in this area is the organising of the staff community involvement programme (CIP) as part of our Chinese New Year (CNY) celebration. Every year, the staff hosts a group of needy elderly from Henderson Heights to join the staff in our school’s CNY celebration. These CIP activities have been very well-received by our staff who find the activities very helpful in adding new perspectives and meaning in their daily work. Even though we were not able to gather for a themed lunch event to celebrate ‘Teachers’ Day’ this year due to the COVID-19 situation, we continued to show our appreciation for the teachers and staff through a Teachers’ Day gift pack which consisted of an individually written card, a customised towel and shopping vouchers. In addition, we also celebrate happy occasions with our staff for important events such as the birth of their newborns by presenting them with shopping vouchers.

To meet the health needs of our staff, the SWB promotes a healthy lifestyle among the staff by coordinating the healthy lifestyle programme regularly for the staff with our ‘Fruit of the Month’ programme. This year, due to Safe Management measures, the SWB coordinated a complimentary health screening for our staff by a professional medical team in a stipulated medical centre with the staff scheduling their own appointments, in place of the usual annual in-house health screening. 

The SWB continues to engage staff and stakeholders for feedback and ideas that can contribute towards the continuous improvement in our workplan to enhance the wellbeing of our staff. Even while we build the capacity and capability of our staff to face future challenges in life and the working environment by enhancing the well-being of our staff, the SWB also anchors our staff on the cultivation of "heartware" and intrinsic motivation which makes our work in education so unique. SWB actively engages our staff in building and sustaining their inner well-being, family values and work values. With the SWB providing the opportunities, school management providing the support, and staff taking ownership of their own well-being, the SWB hopes to make Compassvale Secondary School a great place for work as well as growth for our staff.
