The CVSS Alumni plays an important role as they serve as champions of the North Star Spirit and role models for our current North Stars to emulate. They also advocate giving back to CVSS as they continue contributing to the school after graduation. The Alumni is a platform for our graduates to stay connected with the school. We hope to provide graduates with up-to-date news on the school and opportunities for them to continue serving the school through different platforms, such as CCAs.

In this star, it is hoped that our alumni will be the champions of the North Star Spirit. We are also the ambassadors for CVSS, where we will be a proud representation of CVSS wherever we are and in whatever we do. We are also advocates of giving back to CVSS, where we will contribute to the school in one way or another. Lastly, we also serve to be role models for our current North Stars to emulate.

CVSS encourages our graduates to respect the school and be good role models to our students. Hence, we appreciate that our graduates are properly attired when visiting CVSS.

  
Graduates who are not properly dressed (i.e. wearing revealing clothes, sleeveless and/or translucent tops, shorts and slippers) will not be allowed to enter the school.
