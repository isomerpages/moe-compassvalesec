Partnership involves parents, families and school working together to benefit children. Each recognises, respects and values what the other party does and says. Partnership involves responsibility from all parties. In CVSS, we value this partnership and are appreciative of the firm support from our parents. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, schools have moved towards home-based learning (HBL) over the last couple of years, and parents’ partnership with teachers have become even more crucial in guiding our students to be more resilient and self-disciplined during the HBL period. In addition, before most school activities were halted, our Parent Support Group (PSG) was actively involved in school programmes that showcased positive role-modelling for our students to see that their parents are always ready to support them in achieving their fullest potential.  

### Parent Engagement Events - 2021

**1. Secondary One Parent’s Talk**  

As part of the school’s effort in helping our Secondary One students transit to secondary school life, the Secondary One Parent’s Talk aimed to provide parents with an overview of secondary school life in CVSS to enable them to better support their children in their transition. Due to the prevailing SMM, an inaugural Webinar was conducted where the school leaders and various key personnel shared information on school matters. Mr Christopher Lian, Chairperson of our Parent Support Group (PSG), also introduced parents to PSG and shared his first-hand experiences with incoming parents. Parents also had the opportunity to interact with their children’s form teachers as well fellow parents of the same class via a class-based zoom session.

  

**2. Meet The Form Teacher sessions**  

The Covid-19 pandemic did not deter our form teachers from persisting in their efforts to “meet up” with parents to discuss the progress and development of their children. The school tapped on the affordances of technology to engage parents from all levels on 27 & 28 May 2021. These sessions have enabled the form teachers to connect with the parents and strengthen their partnership in supporting the growth and development of each child.

### Parent Support Group Events

### 2021
### PSG Meeting:

Even though PSG engagements were reduced greatly during the pandemic, PSG tried to innovate and continued to conduct meetings online via platforms like Zoom . In April this year, the PSG meet-up provided an opportunity for parents to interact and share their experiences with one another on how they managed working from home and monitoring their children’s learning. School Leaders joined in the session and our Vice-Principal, Ms Jacelyn Kee took the chance to share further information about the school’s plans for Blended Learning (BL) and Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) as students from Secondary 1 to 3 would be getting their personalised learning device (PLD) by the end of the year. Feedback was gathered from the parents, which enabled the school to enhance its communication and support in this area.

As part of the school’s orientation programme for Sec 1 students, a Parents’ Talk was conducted to enable parents to gain an overview of secondary school life in CVSS, in both curricular and co-curricular aspect, and also provide them with an understanding on how they can support their children in the transition. Our Parent Support Group (PSG) Chairperson, Mr Christopher Lian, also shared how parents can guide and interact with their children during this transition. Subsequently, our parents proceeded to their children’s form classroom to interact with their children’s form teachers as well as get to know fellow parents of the same class.

Our PSG has always been passionate about co-hosting elderly guests at our annual CNY celebration and members generously volunteer to prepare festive bags for our elderly guests. Preparation for these festive bags would begin early in the year whereby PSG EXCOs would activate the donation drive in kinds only and parents of students from all levels would either contribute items or volunteer their time on a Saturday morning to pack these festive bags together with their children. On the actual day of CNY celebration, our PSG members even came to school to mingle with and take care of these elderly guests.
