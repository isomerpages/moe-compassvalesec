Partnership involves parents, families and school working together to benefit children. Each recognises, respects and values what the other party does and says. Partnership involves responsibility from all parties. In CVSS, we value this partnership and are appreciative of the firm support from our parents. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, schools have moved towards home-based learning (HBL) over the last couple of years, and parents’ partnership with teachers have become even more crucial in guiding our students to be more resilient and self-disciplined during the HBL period. In addition, before most school activities were halted, our Parent Support Group (PSG) was actively involved in school programmes that showcased positive role-modelling for our students to see that their parents are always ready to support them in achieving their fullest potential.  

### Parent Engagement Events - 2021

**1. Secondary One Parent’s Talk**  

As part of the school’s effort in helping our Secondary One students transit to secondary school life, the Secondary One Parent’s Talk aimed to provide parents with an overview of secondary school life in CVSS to enable them to better support their children in their transition. Due to the prevailing SMM, an inaugural Webinar was conducted where the school leaders and various key personnel shared information on school matters. Mr Christopher Lian, Chairperson of our Parent Support Group (PSG), also introduced parents to PSG and shared his first-hand experiences with incoming parents. Parents also had the opportunity to interact with their children’s form teachers as well fellow parents of the same class via a class-based zoom session.

  

**2. Meet The Form Teacher sessions**  

The Covid-19 pandemic did not deter our form teachers from persisting in their efforts to “meet up” with parents to discuss the progress and development of their children. The school tapped on the affordances of technology to engage parents from all levels on 27 & 28 May 2021. These sessions have enabled the form teachers to connect with the parents and strengthen their partnership in supporting the growth and development of each child.
