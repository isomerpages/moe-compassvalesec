The Staff Professional Development (SPD) Committee aims to develop teachers who are holistic educators, collaborative learners and effective learning designers.  The committee aspires to develop teachers who can ably craft learning opportunities which are purposeful, integrative and engaging to cater to students’ diverse learning needs.  The SPD committee comprises of the School Staff Developer (SSD), 1 Lead Teacher (LT) and 7 Senior Teachers (ST).   
  

### Staff Professional Development

The SPD committee works closely with the ICT department to prepare the teachers well for the advent of Blended Learning and Personalised Digital Learning Programme (BL-PDLP).  The change in the educational landscape as well as the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has made blended learning a key part of students’ learning in schools.  As such, CVSS makes it a priority to level up teachers’ competencies so that they can be effective in engaging students both online and in the classroom.  The PD (professional development) programmes also prepare teachers to make full use of the affordances of personalised learning devices (PLDs) in the classrooms.

The SPD committee was involved in the Staff PD (Professional Development) Day in June which focused on ICT tools and platforms such as the Google Classroom and the Student Learning Space.  Another PD Day was conducted in November which rounded off teachers’ professional learning in e-pedagogy. The SPD committee members were in the thick of action, sharing teaching practices for learning with PLDs.  There was also the sharing of the Singapore Teaching Practice and discussions on future directions viz-a-viz Education Minister Chan Chun Sing’s speech at the Schools’ Work Plan Seminar.  The PD Day was not just a successful event in terms of the rich professional sharing and learning, but it also showed the resiliency of our educators to learn and grow despite the constraints of PD using virtual mode.  All our staff also attended the Mindfulness workshop to round off a year of hard work. Mental well-being is an area of focus for both staff and students in the context of challenges brought about by the pandemic. Being trained in mindfulness allows teachers to manage their mental well-being better and more importantly, help their students to improve their self-management skills.

### Professional Sharing on External Platforms

The school encourages teachers to take part in professional learning opportunities on external platforms so as to improve their teaching practices and deepen their craft.  This year, 25 teachers conducted sharing at various platforms such as the MOE Teachers' Conference and ExCEL Fest 2021, teacher-led workshops, networked learning communities, the Academy of Singapore Teachers and other platforms.

### Other PD Work by SPD Committee

The SPD committee performs various duties and uses different avenues to value-add to the professional growth of teachers in our school.  The instructional mentoring programme provides guidance to beginning teachers in their first few years in the teaching service.  Instructional Mentors (IM) meet their mentees on a regular basis to sharpen their teaching practice.  New staff go through the induction programme which serves to bring the staff who are new to our school, up to speed as to the key programmes and processes in the school.  SPD committee members also conduct sharing sessions with colleagues in their department on a regular basis.   
  

### Recognition of Quality Work through Awards

In a year filled with uncertainties, abrupt changes and unexpected challenges, our staff endeavoured tirelessly to help our students achieve their best in both academic and non-academic pursuits.  They act as role models in striving for excellence in their respective areas of work. In 2021, the good work of a number of our staff were recognised through various awards. 

Mdm Edwina Cheng was accorded the highest honour for teachers, the President's Award for Teachers 2021, for her tireless efforts in overseeing our school’s Gear-Up programme.  This programme provides after-school support and care for students, some of whom come from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Miss Koh Bee Choo was given the Listening Educator for Advancement and Progress (LEAP) award by Hokkien Huay Kuan.  This is the first time a teacher in CVSS has achieved this award, which recognises teachers who have made a positive difference in the lives of their students.  In a year of many firsts, 2021 also saw the highest number of teachers achieving the Associate of AST award (2) and the MOE Service Excellence Award (4).  Two teams were awarded the MOE Innergy Award (commendation) as well.  Heartiest congratulations to the deserving winners!

The Staff Professional Development (SPD) Committee aims to develop teachers who are holistic educators, collaborative learners and effective learning designers who craft learning opportunities which are purposeful, integrative and engaging to cater to students’ diverse learning needs.  The SPD committee comprising the School Staff Developer (SSD), 1 Lead Teacher (LT) and 7 Senior Teachers (ST) has been instrumental in driving professional development of staff alongside various structures, systems and processes that have been put in place over the years.   

### Staff Professional Development

The SPD committee organised a staff Professional Development (PD) Day in March which engaged the staff on the key focus areas of the MOE Committee of Supply debate 2020.  The PD Day programme also included an ICT workshop and the onboarding of OPAL2.0, a newly launched PD digital platform which offers on-the-go, self-directed, self-paced professional learning for teachers.  

The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic caused a number of PD events to be cancelled but also created opportunities for teachers to pick up new skills.  The Circuit Breaker period was a challenging period for teachers as they had to find ways to ensure teaching and learning carried on effectively as schools switched to full home-based learning.  Teachers learnt new and better methods and tools to engage their students via synchronous as well as asynchronous modes.  They also collaborated, shared good practices among themselves and improved on their teaching strategies as they gained experience with online teaching.  

The year-end PD Day was held on 17 November via video conferencing mode.  Teaching staff were provided with important updates and were engaged in discussion about key MOE initiatives such as CCE2021, Blended Learning and the Personal Digital Learning Programme (PDLP).  There was also the sharing of the Singapore Teaching Package professional conversation package by teacher leaders (TL).  The PD Day was not just a successful event in terms of the rich professional sharing and learning, but also proved to be a breakthrough in itself as it was the first time that so many virtual breakout discussions were carried out for over 100 teaching staff. The Staff Professional Development (SPD) Committee aims to develop passionate and professional staff who lead, care and inspire with the desired Singapore teacher outcomes for the 21st Century in line with the Teacher Growth Model.  

The Staff Professional Development committee comprising the School Staff Developer (SSD), 1 Lead Teacher (LT) and 6 Senior Teachers (ST) has been instrumental in driving professional development of staff alongside various structures, systems and processes that have been put in place over the years.

### Professional Learning Community

Since 2010, the school has established itself as a Professional Learning Community (PLC), which is a whole school approach to enhancing student learning through teacher collaboration in professional learning.  In their Professional Learning Teams (PLT) which meet once a week, teachers share best practices, generate ideas, research an area of interest and collectively strengthen their professional practice.  Although their work was disrupted by restrictions brought about by the pandemic, the PLTs achieved a bumper crop of prizes at the annual Innergy Awards.  In all, the teams won 1 Silver and 2 Commendation awards (see details in Staff Achievements).   

### Professional Sharing on External Platforms

The school encourages teachers to take part in professional learning opportunities on external platforms so as to improve their pedagogical practices, deepen their craft and hone their teaching skills.  This year, 12 teachers conducted sharing at various platforms such as teacher-led workshops, iMTL networked learning community e-Symposium, the Crescent Academy for Digital Age Learning (CrADLe), Academy of Singapore Teachers, OPAL2.0 and other platforms.  These sharing efforts are win-win opportunities for our teachers and their audiences alike as all sides benefit from the experience.  For example, our MTL teachers worked with Master Teachers (MTT) from the Singapore Centre for Chinese Language (SCCL) as they shared their good practices with other teachers in the fraternity.  Through close collaboration with the MTT, our teachers sharpened their teaching pedagogies as well.

### Other PD Work by SPD Committee

There are numerous structures and processes that enable the SPD committee to value-add to the professional growth of teachers in our school.  The instructional mentoring programme provides guidance to beginning teachers in their first few years in teaching service.  Instructional Mentors (IM) meet their mentees on a regular basis to sharpen their teaching practice.  In October, our IM also met with MTT from AST who provided consultancy to value-add to our mentoring programme. The feedback from MTT was very positive and our school will continue to work with them next year to enhance our methods and processes.  Our committee also organised induction programmes for new staff posted to our school.  This programme enables our new staff to hit the ground running and perform their duties well.

The SPD committee members contribute to the professional growth of teachers in their respective IP departments through sharing, informal coaching and serving as resource persons for their colleagues.  For example, a few TL shared with their department colleagues differentiated instruction strategies in semester 2 this year.

### Spirit of Professionalism and Excellence

In a year filled with uncertainties, abrupt changes and unexpected challenges, teachers have risen to the occasion and ensured that teaching and learning was not compromised.  They exercised initiative and adaptability in learning and applying new blended learning approaches.  They constantly sought to improve their practices through hard work and active collaboration.  The teachers have indeed displayed a true spirit of lifelong learning, professionalism and excellence.
