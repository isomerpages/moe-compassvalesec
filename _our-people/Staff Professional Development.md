The Staff Professional Development (SPD) Committee aims to develop teachers who are holistic educators, collaborative learners and effective learning designers.  The committee aspires to develop teachers who can ably craft learning opportunities which are purposeful, integrative and engaging to cater to students’ diverse learning needs.  The SPD committee comprises of the School Staff Developer (SSD), 1 Lead Teacher (LT) and 7 Senior Teachers (ST).   
  

### Staff Professional Development

The SPD committee works closely with the ICT department to prepare the teachers well for the advent of Blended Learning and Personalised Digital Learning Programme (BL-PDLP).  The change in the educational landscape as well as the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has made blended learning a key part of students’ learning in schools.  As such, CVSS makes it a priority to level up teachers’ competencies so that they can be effective in engaging students both online and in the classroom.  The PD (professional development) programmes also prepare teachers to make full use of the affordances of personalised learning devices (PLDs) in the classrooms.

The SPD committee was involved in the Staff PD (Professional Development) Day in June which focused on ICT tools and platforms such as the Google Classroom and the Student Learning Space.  Another PD Day was conducted in November which rounded off teachers’ professional learning in e-pedagogy. The SPD committee members were in the thick of action, sharing teaching practices for learning with PLDs.  There was also the sharing of the Singapore Teaching Practice and discussions on future directions viz-a-viz Education Minister Chan Chun Sing’s speech at the Schools’ Work Plan Seminar.  The PD Day was not just a successful event in terms of the rich professional sharing and learning, but it also showed the resiliency of our educators to learn and grow despite the constraints of PD using virtual mode.  All our staff also attended the Mindfulness workshop to round off a year of hard work. Mental well-being is an area of focus for both staff and students in the context of challenges brought about by the pandemic. Being trained in mindfulness allows teachers to manage their mental well-being better and more importantly, help their students to improve their self-management skills.

### Professional Sharing on External Platforms

The school encourages teachers to take part in professional learning opportunities on external platforms so as to improve their teaching practices and deepen their craft.  This year, 25 teachers conducted sharing at various platforms such as the MOE Teachers' Conference and ExCEL Fest 2021, teacher-led workshops, networked learning communities, the Academy of Singapore Teachers and other platforms.
