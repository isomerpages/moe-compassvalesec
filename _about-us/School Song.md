## Realising the Star Within

*Lyrics and music: Er Wee San and Huang Ding Xiang*

**We seize each day with confidence, soaring with creativity**

**To bring out the best that we can achieve, thereâ€™s a star in all of us**

**We reach out to all with compassion, as we live our dreams with commitment**

**Living and learning with passion, as we realise the star within**

**We want to shine like a star in the sky**

**We want to show the world, what we can be**

**We will stand tall and proud, as the star of the north**

**A light to inspire all**

**We want to shine like a star in the sky**

**We want to show the world, what we can be**

**We will stand tall and proud, as the star of the north**
