<p><strong>2025 is a special year!^&nbsp; It is CVSS’ 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary!</strong>
</p>
<p>As a school community, we celebrate 25 years of outstanding achievements
through realising the potential of all the students who pass through our
school.&nbsp; We continue to build on the strengths developed and sharpened
over the past two years, to design excellent learning experiences and growth
opportunities for all our students. All learning in the school is organised
into <a href="https://www.compassvalesec.moe.edu.sg/our-programmes/the-compassvale-experience/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Six Integrated Competencies and Development Clusters</a> to
ensure a close knit of the disciplines; students also gain knowledge, competencies
and skillsets for world-ready relevance through our <a href="https://www.compassvalesec.moe.edu.sg/our-programmes/distinctive-programmes/aeronautics-applied-learning-programme-alp/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Enhanced ALP ACES (Aeronautics, Coding, Engineering)</a>,
<a href="https://www.compassvalesec.moe.edu.sg/our-programmes/distinctive-programmes/learning-for-life-programme-llp/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">sustainability-focused LLP – Green Compass Programme</a>, <a href="https://www.compassvalesec.moe.edu.sg/our-programmes/distinctive-programmes/digital-media-literacy/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Digital Media Literacies</a>,
and <a href="https://for.edu.sg/perspectives" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Perspectives Overseas Learning Experiences</a>.
This total learning experience ensures all our students are agile and nimble,
able to thrive in their respective futures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As such, almost 9 in 10 of our latest batch of graduates qualified for
JC/MI; virtually all qualified for Polytechnic pathways. PFP and DPP percentages
were also high. Our staff also did the school proud, with members recognised
as Outstanding Youth in Education (OYEA), Presidents’ Award Teacher (PAT)
and Fulbright Distinguished Educator. These outcomes attest to the rigour
and quality of education that CVSS offers.</p>
<p>As a school community, we have grown significantly this year, welcoming
11 Secondary 1 classes. This shows that CVSS continues to be a school of
choice for the community – and we intend to honour our community’s belief
in us. In preparation for this bumper cohort, several infrastructural updates
were put in place last year. We have a new classroom block designed to
enable contemporary pedagogical approaches; we also updated all the learning
spaces in the school to accommodate more students; the library was also
refreshed to 21<sup>st</sup> century standards. More teachers were also
recruited to ensure teacher-to-student numbers remain sustainable. We also
worked on enhancing practices and processes in the school for greater effectiveness,
across both Teaching &amp; Learning, and school administration – several
practices were recognised as ‘best-practices’ with national level innovation
awards. These were shared with the education fraternity to uplift everyone,
a belief we hold strongly.</p>
<p>As we excitedly unfold 2025, many vibrant and uplifting experiences awaits
us all – be it in curriculum or co-curriculum. Most recently, our signature
<a href="https://for.edu.sg/perspectives" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Perspectives</a>programme adds another ASEAN country into its learning
menu! We will continue to sharpen CVSS’ total learning experience, because
this will ensure we continue to cultivate important dispositions of Confidence,
Commitment, Creativity and Compassion. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In doing so, we will build a vibrant and uplifting community, where all
will Learn, Grow and Lead, to realise their star within.&nbsp; To find
