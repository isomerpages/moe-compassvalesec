<h3>2024</h3><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Principal_s_message_2024.jpg"></div><p>Welcome, students and parents, to the 2024 school year!</p><p>We start 2024 on excellent footing. Our students did very well in 2023. Across the various academic competitions, olympiads, research projects, CCAs, and skills competitions, they consistently emerged top-ranked. This demonstrates a high level of not only confidence, but also adaptability and agility in both cognitive, physical and socioemotional domains. You can find out more from our social media pages here: FaceBook, Instagram. &lt;hyperlink each to the corresponding site&gt;.</p><p>We are committed to ensure we continue to offer such excellent learning experiences and growth opportunities year-on-year, for all our students. Therefore, keeping national and global developments in view, we have refreshed the school’s strategies to take us to the next higher stage. We worked hard to reconceptualise how learning could be. Building on our existing capabilities, we will strengthen the connection of lesson design to subject disciplinarity, and incorporate greater hands-on learning opportunities. Henceforth, learning will cut across cross the disciplines via our Six Integrated Competencies and Development Clusters &lt;hyperlink this to The Compassvale Experience page&gt;. This is important, because we want our students to explore connections between different subject areas and be cognitively nimble and adaptive.</p><p>We are also deepening our signature Applied Learning Programme (ALP), to teach students important world-ready skills such as Coding and Inventive Thinking via Design in Engineering projects. We now term our ALP as ACES – <a href="https://www.compassvalesec.moe.edu.sg/our-programmes/distinctive-programmes/aeronautics-applied-learning-programme-alp/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Aeronautics, Coding, Engineering</a> , undergirded with the key theme of Sustainability. ALP – ACES will be further complemented by our refreshed <a href="https://www.compassvalesec.moe.edu.sg/our-programmes/distinctive-programmes/learning-for-life-programme-llp/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Learning for Life Programme, Green Compass Programme (LLP – GCP)</a> , where students are exposed to important sustainability-relevant knowledge, skills, values and attitudes, via experiential and expert-led workshops and projects. A <a href="https://www.compassvalesec.moe.edu.sg/our-programmes/distinctive-programmes/digital-media-literacy/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Digital and Media Literacy (DML) Curriculum</a> will be rolled out progressively from this year. Students will be able to learn through a structured, in-house developed curriculum, crucial digital literacy skills that will give them an edge in our hyper-digitalised world.</p><p>Through the conduct of our curriculum and co-curriculum experiences, we endeavour to cultivate important learning dispositions of curiosity, self-directedness and resilience. In tandem with the amplification of student ownership, communication platforms and leadership avenues, we will give more students the chance to discover their strengths, learn from the mistakes they make, to realise the star within them.</p><p>I look forward to your continued partnership and support, as we build a vibrant and uplifting community, where all will Learn, Grow and Lead.</p><p>Wishing all a purposeful and enriching 2024.</p><p></p><p><strong>Mr Chua Tung Kian</strong></p><p><strong>Principal</strong></p><p><strong>Compassvale Secondary School</strong></p><p></p>
