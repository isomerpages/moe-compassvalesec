Welcome, students, parents and colleagues, to the 2023 school year. I am honoured to be entrusted with the responsibility of leadership for Compassvale Secondary School. I want to convey my appreciation and gratitude to the former principal, Mr Chia Chor Yann, for his exemplary leadership of the school over the past 6 years.

Since its establishment in 2000, Compassvale Secondary School has established itself as a school of choice in the northeast. Our students consistently do very well holistically, and gain rich authentic learning experiences that set them up for success in their future endeavours. This would not be possible without a strong team – caring, capable, competent teachers, supportive parents and a close-knit community of stakeholders.

As an educator, I firmly believe that every child is unique, with his/her own set of strengths and passions.&nbsp; This is why we differentiate and customise learning in Compassvale to allow students – who we fondly call our North Stars – with different learning dispositions and interests to reach their fullest potential, and more!&nbsp; This is why our school’s motto – Realising the Star Within – is so apt and enduring.&nbsp; Through the learning experiences and opportunities, we ensure students gain the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to be globally-competent citizens who are nimble and thrive amidst uncertainty, yet grounded by core values of graciousness, gratitude, respect, responsibility, resilience, integrity and teamwork (G2R3IT).  

I am excited to continue to grow Compassvale from strength to strength with the school team, and I invite you to partner with us on this journey towards excellence, to realise our&nbsp;_stars_&nbsp;and help each child find their compass in life.&nbsp;
