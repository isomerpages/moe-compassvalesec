In CVSS, we believe there is a star in all our students and help our students find the compass in their lives and realise the star within. We want all our students to be like the North Star, shining brightly with good character and excellence in both academic and non-academic domains, as a guiding light for the community and the world. We aim to foster a vibrant learning community with a nurturing school climate through diverse and engaging school programmes with ample opportunities for student participation and student voice.&nbsp;
 
Our culture and ethos for all students and staff are:  

**Achieve our Best** -&nbsp;Strive for excellence and excel&nbsp;in everything we do;

**Believe in Ourselves** - Everyone can achieve and all can succeed;  
  

**Care for One Another** - Encourage and support one another at all times;&nbsp;and

**Diversity in Harmony** - Embrace diversity and celebrate our differences
